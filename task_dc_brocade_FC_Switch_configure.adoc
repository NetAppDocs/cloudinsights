Cloud Insights uses the Brocade FC Switch (SSH) data collector to discover inventory for Brocade or rebranded switch devices running Factored Operating System (FOS) firmware 4.2 and later. Devices in both FC switch and Access Gateway modes are supported. 

== Terminology 

Cloud Insights acquires the following inventory information from the Brocade FC Switch data collector. For each asset type acquired by Cloud Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Switch|Switch
|Port|Port
|Virtual Fabric, Physical Fabric|Fabric
|Zone|Zone
|Logical Switch|Logical Switch
|Virtual Volume|Volume
|LSAN Zone|IVR Zone
|===

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collector.

== Requirements

* There must be IP connectivity to all switches in the fabric. If you select the Discover all switches in the fabric check box, Cloud Insights identifies all the switches in the fabric; however, it needs IP connectivity to these additional switches to discover them.
* The same account is needed globally across all switches in the fabric. You can use PuTTY (open source terminal emulator) to confirm access.
* Ports 161 and 162 must be open to all switches in the fabric for SNMP performance polling.
