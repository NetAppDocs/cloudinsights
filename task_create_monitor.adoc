[.lead]
You create monitors to set thresholds that trigger alerts to notify you about issues related to the resources in your network. For example, you can create a monitor to alert for _node write latency_ for any of a multitude of protocols.

TIP: Monitors and Alerting is available in all Cloud Insights Editions, however, Basic Edition is subject to the following:
+
* You may only have up to five custom monitors active at a time. Any monitors beyond five will be created in or moved to _Paused_ state. 
* Vmdk, VirtualMachine, Host, and DataStore metrics are not supported. If you have monitors created for these metrics, they will be deleted when downgrading to Basic Edition.

toc::[]

//When the monitored threshold and conditions are reached or exceeded, Cloud Insights creates an alert. A Monitor can have a _Warning_ threshold, a _Critical_ threshold, or both. Log Monitors can also have an _Informational_ alert level.

Monitors allow you to set thresholds on metrics generated by "infrastructure" objects such as storage, VM, EC2, and ports, as well as for "integration" data such as those collected for Kubernetes, ONTAP advanced metrics, and Telegraf plugins. These _metric_ monitors alert you when warning-level or critical-level thresholds are crossed.

You can also create monitors to trigger warning-, critical-, or informational-level alerts when specified _log events_ are detected.

Cloud Insights provides a number of link:task_system_monitors.html[System-Defined Monitors] as well, based on your environment. 


== Metric or Log Monitor? 

. From the Cloud Insights menu, click *Alerts > Manage Monitors*
+
The Monitors list page is displayed, showing currently configured monitors. 

. To modify an existing monitor, click the monitor name in the list.

. To add a monitor, Click *+ Monitor*. 
+
image:Monitor_log_or_metric.png[Choose system or log monitor]
+
When you add a new monitor, you are prompted to create a Metric Monitor or a Log Monitor.

* _Metric_ monitors alert on infrastructure- or performance-related triggers
* _Log_ monitors alert on log-related activity

+
After you choose your monitor type, the Monitor Configuration dialog is displayed. Configuration varies depending on which type of monitor you are creating.


=== Metric Monitor

. In the drop-down, search for and choose an object type and metric to monitor.

You can set filters to narrow down which object attributes or metrics to monitor. 

//image:select_metric_to_monitor.png[Select Metric]

image:MonitorMetricFilter.png[Metrics Filtering]

//When working with integration data (Kubernetes, ONTAP Advanced Data, etc.), metric filtering works against the data samples themselves, not the objects as with infrastructure data (storage, VMs, ports, etc.).

When working with integration data (Kubernetes, ONTAP Advanced Data, etc.), metric filtering removes the individual/unmatched data points from the plotted data series, unlike infrastructure data (storage, VM, ports etc.) where filters work on the aggregated value of the data series and potentially remove the entire object from the chart.

//image:IntegrationMetricFilterExample.png[Integration Metric Filtering]

TIP: To create a multi-condition monitor (e.g., IOPS > X and latency > Y), define the first condition as a threshold and the second condition as a filter.


==== Define the Conditions of the Monitor. 

. After choosing the object and metric to monitor, set the Warning-level and/or Critical-level thresholds.
. For the _Warning_ level, enter 200 for our example. The dashed line indicating this Warning level displays in the example graph.
. For the _Critical_ level, enter 400. The dashed line indicating this Critical level displays in the example graph.
+
The graph displays historical data. The Warning and Critical level lines on the graph are a visual representation of the Monitor, so you can easily see when the Monitor might trigger an alert in each case. 

. For the occurence interval, choose _Continuously_ for a period of _15 Minutes_.
+
You can choose to trigger an alert the moment a threshold is breached, or wait until the threshold has been in continuous breach for a period of time. In our example, we do not want to be alerted every time the Total IOPS peaks above the Warning or Critical level, but only when a monitored object continuously exceeds one of these levels for at least 15 minutes.
+
//image:define_monitor_conditions.png[Define Conditions]
image:Monitor_metric_conditions.png[Define the monitor's conditions]






=== Log Monitor

When creating a *Log monitor*, first choose which log to monitor from the available log list. You can then filter based on the available attributes as above.

For example, you might choose to filter for "object.store.unavailable" message type in the logs.netapp.ems source:

NOTE: The Log Monitor filter cannot be empty. 

image:Monitor_log_monitor_filter.png[choose which log to monitor, and set a filter]



==== Define the alert behavior

Choose how you want to alert when a log alert is triggered. You can set the monitor to alert with _Warning_, _Critical_, or _Informational_ severity, based on the filter conditions you set above.

image:Monitor_log_alert_behavior.png[define the log behavior to monitor]


==== Define the alert resolution behavior

You can choose how an log monitor alert is resolved. You are presented with three choices:

* *Resolve instantly*: The alert is immediately resolved with no further action needed
* *Resolve based on time*: The alert is resolved after the specified time has passed
* *Resolve based on log entry*: The alert is resolved when a subsequent log activity has occurred. For example, when an object is logged as "available".

image:Monitor_log_monitor_resolution.png[Alert Resolution]



=== Select notification type and recipients

In the _Set up team notification(s)_ section, you can choose whether to alert your team via email or Webhook.

image:Webhook_Choose_Monitor_Notification.png[Choose alerting method]

*Alerting via Email:*

Specify the email recipients for alert notifications. If desired, you can choose different recipients for warning or critical alerts.

image:email_monitor_alerts.png[Email Alert Recipients]

*Alerting via Webhook:*

Specify the webhook(s) for alert notifications. If desired, you can choose different webhooks for warning or critical alerts.

image:Webhook_Monitor_Notifications.png[Webhook Alerting]

NOTE: ONTAP Data Collector notifications take precedence over any specific Monitor notifications that are relevant to the cluster/data collector. The recipient list you set for the Data Collector itself will receive the data collector alerts. If there are no active data collector alerts, then monitor-generated alerts will be sent to specific monitor recipients.


=== Setting Corrective Actions or Additional Information

You can add an optional description as well as additional insights and/or corrective actions by filling in the *Add an Alert Description* section. The description can be up to 1024 characters and will be sent with the alert. The insights/corrective action field can be up to 67,000 characters and will be displayed in the summary section of the alert landing page.

In these fields you can provide notes, links, or steps to take to correct or otherwise address the alert.

image:Monitors_Alert_Description.png[Alert Corrective Actions and Description]


=== Save your Monitor

. If desired, you can add a description of the monitor. 
+
. Give the Monitor a meaningful name and click *Save*.
+
Your new monitor is added to the list of active Monitors.



== Monitor List

The Monitor page lists the currently configured monitors, showing the following:

* Monitor Name
* Status 
* Object/metric being monitored
* Conditions of the Monitor

You can choose to temporarily pause monitoring of an object type by clicking the menu to the right of the monitor and selecting *Pause*. When you are ready to resume monitoring, click *Resume*.

You can copy a monitor by selecting *Duplicate* from the menu. You can then modify the new monitor and change the object/metric, filter, conditions, email recipients, etc.

If a monitor is no longer needed, you can delete it by selecting *Delete* from the menu.


== Monitor Groups

Grouping allows you to view and manage related monitors. For example, you can have a monitor group dedicated to the storage in your environment, or monitors relevant to a certain recipient list. 

image:Monitors_GroupList.png[Monitor Grouping]

The following monitor groups are shown. The number of monitors contained in a group is shown next to the group name.

* *All Monitors* lists all monitors.
* *Custom Monitors* lists all user-created monitors.
* *Suspended Monitors* will list any system monitors that have been suspended by Cloud Insights.
* Cloud Insights will also show a number of *System Monitor Groups*, which will list one or more groups of link:task_system_monitors.html[system-defined monitors], including ONTAP Infrastructure and Workload monitors. 
//* *Data Collection* monitors will alert on Data Collector or Acquisition Unit issues.

NOTE: Custom monitors can be paused, resumed, deleted, or moved to another group. System-defined monitors can be paused and resumed but can not be deleted or moved. 

=== Suspended Monitors

This group will only be shown if Cloud Insights has suspended one or more monitors. A monitor may be suspended if it is generating excessive or continuous alerts. If the monitor is a custom monitor, modify the conditions to prevent the continuous alerting, and then resume the monitor. The monitor will be removed from the Suspended Monitors group when the issue causing the suspension is resolved.


////
=== Data Collection Monitors

This group will show monitors 
////


=== System-Defined Monitors

These groups will show monitors provided by Cloud Insights, as long as your environment contains the devices and/or log availability required by the monitors.

System-Defined monitors cannot be modified, moved to another group, or deleted. However, you can duplicate a system monitor and modify or move the duplicate. 

System monitors may include monitors for ONTAP Infrastructure (storage, volume, etc.) or Workloads (i.e. log monitors), or other groups. NetApp is constantly evaluating customer need and product functionality, and will update or add to system monitors and groups as needed.


=== Custom Monitor Groups

You can create your own groups to contain monitors based on your needs. For example, you may want a group for all of your storage-related monitors.

To create a new custom monitor group, click the *"+" Create New Monitor Group* button. Enter a name for the group and click *Create Group*. An empty group is created with that name. 

To add monitors to the group, go to the _All Monitors_ group (recommended) and do one of the following:

* To add a single monitor, click the menu to the right of the monitor and select _Add to Group_. Choose the group to which to add the monitor.
* Click on the monitor name to open the monitor's edit view, and select a group in the _Associate to a monitor group_ section.
+
image:Monitors_AssociateToGroup.png[Associate to group]

//* To add multiple monitors to a group, select them by clicking the checkbox next to each monitor, then click the *Bulk Actions* button and select _Move to Group_.

Remove monitors by clicking on a group and selecting _Remove from Group_ from the menu. You can not remove monitors from the _All Monitors_ or _Custom Monitors_ group. To delete a monitor from these groups, you must delete the monitor itself.

//To remove a monitor from a group while editing the monitor, in the _Associate with a group_ section, click the *X* next to the group name.

NOTE: Removing a monitor from a group does not delete the monitor from Cloud Insights. To completely remove a monitor, select the monitor and click _Delete_. This also removes it from the group to which it belonged and it is no longer available to any user.

You can also move a monitor to a different group in the same manner, selecting _Move to Group_. 

//NOTE: Each monitor can belong to only a single group at any given time (in addition to belonging to "All Monitors" and "Custom Monitors"). 

To pause or resume all monitors in a group at once, select the menu for the group and click _Pause_ or _Resume_. 

Use the same menu to rename or delete a group. Deleting a group does not delete the monitors from Cloud Insights; they are still available in _All Monitors_.

=== Creating a Monitor

In the example below, we will create a Monitor to give a Warning alert when _Volume Node NFS Write Latency_ reaches or exceeds 200ms, and a Critical alert when it reaches or exceeds 400ms. We only want to be alerted when either threshold is exceeded for at least 15 continuous minutes.

==== Requirements

* Cloud Insights must be configured to collect integration data, and that data is being collected.
////
////
==== Create the Monitor 

. From the Cloud Insights menu, click *Alerts > Manage Monitors*
+
The Monitors list page is displayed, showing currently configured monitors. 

. To add a monitor, Click *+ Monitor*. To modify an existing monitor, click the monitor name in the list.
+
The Monitor Configuration dialog is displayed.
. In the drop-down, search for and choose an object type and metric to monitor, for example _netapp_ontap_volume_node_nfs_write_latency_.

You can set filters to narrow down which object attributes or metrics to monitor. 

//image:select_metric_to_monitor.png[Select Metric]

image:define_monitor_conditions.png[Define Conditions]


==== Refining the Filter

When you are filtering, as you begin typing you are presented with the option to create a *wildcard filter* based on the current text. Selecting this option will return all results that match the wildcard expression. You can also create *expressions* using NOT or OR, or you can select the "None" option to filter for null values in the field.

image:Type-Ahead_Monitor_1.png[Wildcard Filter]

Filters based on wildcards or expressions (e.g. NOT, OR, "None", etc.) display in dark blue in the filter field. Items that you select directly from the list are displayed in light blue.

image:Type-Ahead-Example-Wildcard-DirectSelect.png[Wildcard Filter Results]

Note that Wildcard and Expression filtering works with text or lists but not with numerics, dates or booleans.



=== Setting Corrective Actions or Additional Information

You can add an optional description as well as additional insights and/or corrective actions by filling in the *Add an Alert Description* section. The description can be up to 1024 characters and will be sent with the alert. The insights/corrective action field can be up to 67,000 characters and will be displayed in the summary section of the alert landing page.

In these fields you can provide notes, links, or steps to take to correct or otherwise address the alert.

image:Monitors_Alert_Description.png[Alert Corrective Actions and Description]




=== Select notification type and recipients

In the _Set up team notification(s)_ section, you can choose whether to alert your team via email or Webhook.

image:Webhook_Choose_Monitor_Notification.png[Choose alerting method]

*Alerting via Email:*

Specify the email recipients for alert notifications. If desired, you can choose different recipients for warning or critical alerts.

image:email_monitor_alerts.png[Email Alert Recipients]

*Alerting via Webhook:*

Specify the webhook(s) for alert notifications. If desired, you can choose different webhooks for warning or critical alerts.

image:Webhook_Monitor_Notifications.png[Webhook Alerting]

==== Warning vs. Critical vs. Resolved alerting

Whether a monitor sends a Warning, Critical, or Resolved alert notification depends on which threshold is crossed:

* Crossing from non-triggered to WARNING - Send Warning Alert
* Crossing from non-triggered to CRITICAL - Send Critical Alert
* Crossing from WARNING to CRITICAL - Send Critical Alert
* Crossing from CRITICAL to WARNING - Send Warning Alert
* Crossing from WARNING to Non-Triggered - Send RESOLVED Alert
* Crossing from CRITICAL to Non-Triggered - Send RESOLVED Alert


=== Save your Monitor

. If desired, you can add a description of the monitor. 
+
. Give the Monitor a meaningful name and click *Save*.
+
Your new monitor is added to the list of active Monitors.

=== Monitor List

The Monitor page lists the currently configured monitors, showing the following:

* Monitor Name
* Status 
* Object/metric being monitored
* Conditions of the Monitor

You can view any active alerts associated with a monitor by clicking rthe "bell" icon next to the Monitor name.
image:ViewActiveAlerts.png[Icon showing active alerts for a monitor]

You can choose to temporarily suspend monitoring of an object type by clicking the menu to the right of the monitor and selecting *Pause*. When you are ready to resume monitoring, click *Resume*.

You can copy a monitor by selecting *Duplicate* from the menu. You can then modify the new monitor and change the object/metric, filter, conditions, email recipients, etc.

If a monitor is no longer needed, you can delete it by selecting *Delete* from the menu.



== Monitor Groups

Grouping allows you to view and manage related monitors. For example, you can have a monitor group dedicated to the storage in your environment, or monitors relevant to a certain recipient list. 

image:Monitors_GroupList.png[Monitor Grouping]

////
////
Two groups are shown by default:

* *All Monitors* lists all monitors.
* *Custom Monitors* lists only user-created monitors.
* *Suspended Monitors* will be shown only if a monitor has been suspended by the system. 
////

////

The number of monitors contained in a group is shown next to the group name.

To create a new group, click the *"+" Create New Monitor Group* button. Enter a name for the group and click *Create Group*. An empty group is created with that name. 

To add monitors to the group, go to the _All Monitors_ group (recommended) and do one of the following:

* To add a single monitor, click the menu to the right of the monitor and select _Add to Group_. Choose the group to which to add the monitor.
* Click on the monitor name to open the monitor's edit view, and select a group in the _Associate to a monitor group_ section.
+

== System-Defined Monitors

Cloud Insights includes a number of system-defined monitors for both metrics and logs. The system monitors available are dependent on the data collectors present in your environment. Because of that, the monitors available in Cloud Insights may change as data collectors are added or their configurations changed.

View the link:task_system_monitors.html[System-Defined Monitors] page for descriptions of monitors included with Cloud Insights.
