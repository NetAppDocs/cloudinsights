You create monitors to set thresholds that trigger alerts to notify you about issues related to the resources in your network. For example, you can create a monitor to alert you when the total utilization for storage pools is greater than 60%.

////
You can create monitors for the following objects:
[cols=6*]
|===
|Datastore|Disk|Hypervisor|Internal volume|Port|Qtree
|Storage|Storage node|Storage pool |VMDK|VM| Volume
|===
////

When the monitored threshold and conditions are reached or exceeded, Cloud Insights creates an alert. A Monitor can have both a _Warning_ and a _Critical_ alert level. In any Monitor, Warning level threshold is optional, Critical threshold is required.

In the example, below, we will create a Monitor to give a Warning alert when Storage total IOPS reaches 3,500, and a Critical alert when IOPS exceeds 4,600. We only want to be alerted when the threshold is breached for at least 15 continuous minutes.

=== Create the Monitor and Choose an Object Type to Monitor

. In the Cloud Insights menu bar, click *Alerts > Monitors*
+
The Monitors page is displayed. Currently configured monitors are listed.

. To add a monitor, Click *+ Monitor*
+
The *Add Monitor* dialog is displayed.
. In the drop-down, choose an object type to monitor. For our example, choose _Storage_.
+
You can set filters to narrow down which storage objects to monitor.


=== Define the Conditions of the Monitor. 

. Choose which counter or metric to monitor. For our example, choose _IOPS - Total_, and select "Greater Than" (>).
. For the _Warning_ level, enter 3500. The dashed line indicating this Warning level displays.
. For the _Critical_ level, enter 4600. The dashed line indicating this Critical level displays.
+
The graph displays historical data. The Warning and Critical level lines on the graph are a visual representation of the Monitor, so you can easily see when the Monitor might trigger an alert in each case. 

. For the occurence interval, choose _Continuously_ for a period of _15 Minutes_.
+
You can choose to trigger an alert the moment a threshold is breached, or wait until the threshold has been in continuous breach for a period of time. In our example, we do not want to be alerted every time the Total IOPS peaks above the Warning or Critical level, but only when a monitored object continuously exceeds one of these levels for at least 15 minutes.

. Give the Monitor a meaningful name and click *Save*.
+
Your new monitor is added to the list of active Monitors.
