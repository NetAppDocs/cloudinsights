[.lead]
You create monitors to set thresholds that trigger alerts to notify you about issues related to the resources in your network. For example, you can create a monitor to alert for _node write latency_ for any of a multitude of protocols.

TIP: Monitors and Alerting is available in Cloud Insights Standard Edition and higher.

When the monitored threshold and conditions are reached or exceeded, Cloud Insights creates an alert. A Monitor can have a _Warning_ threshold, a _Critical_ threshold, or both.

=== Monitor or Performance Policy?

What's the difference between a *Performance Policy* and a *Monitor*?

_Policies_ allow you to set thresholds on "infrastructure" objects such as storage, VM, EC2, and ports. These policies trigger violations when thresholds are met or exceeded. Each violation can be investigated for troubleshooting. Policies are described in detail elsewhere in this link:task_create_performance_policies.html[documentation].

_Monitors_ provide similar functionality for "integration" data such as those collected for Kubernetes, ONTAP advanced metrics, and Telegraf plugins, and alert when thresholds are crossed. With Monitors, you can set thresholds for Warning- or Critical-level alerts, or both. 

Policies and Monitors are available under the *Alerts* menu.

Emails can be sent when a policy or monitor is triggered. 

=== Creating a Monitor

In the example below, we will create a Monitor to give a Warning alert when _Volume Node NFS Write Latency_ reaches or exceeds 200ms, and a Critical alert when it reaches or exceeds 400ms. We only want to be alerted when either threshold is exceeded for at least 15 continuous minutes.

==== Requirements

* Cloud Insights must be configured to collect integration data, and that data is being collected.

==== Create the Monitor 

. From the Cloud Insights menu, click *Alerts > Manage Monitors*
+
The Monitors list page is displayed, showing currently configured monitors. 

. To add a monitor, Click *+ Monitor*. To modify an existing monitor, click the monitor name in the list.
+
The Monitor Configuration dialog is displayed.
. In the drop-down, search for and choose an object type and metric to monitor, for example _netapp_ontap_volume_node_nfs_write_latency_.

You can set filters to narrow down which object attributes or metrics to monitor. 

//image:select_metric_to_monitor.png[Select Metric]

image:MonitorMetricFilter.png[Metrics Filtering]

//When working with integration data (Kubernetes, ONTAP Advanced Data, etc.), metric filtering works against the data samples themselves, not the objects as with infrastructure data (storage, VMs, ports, etc.).

When working with integration data (Kubernetes, ONTAP Advanced Data, etc.), metric filtering removes the individual/unmatched data points from the plotted data series, unlike infrastructure data (storage, VM, ports etc.) where filters work on the aggregated value of the data series and potentially remove the entire object from the chart.

//image:IntegrationMetricFilterExample.png[Integration Metric Filtering]

TIP: To create a multi-condition monitor (e.g., IOPS > X and latency > Y), define the first condition as a threshold and the second condition as a filter.


==== Define the Conditions of the Monitor. 

. After choosing the object and metric to monitor, set the Warning-level and/or Critical-level thresholds.
. For the _Warning_ level, enter 200. The dashed line indicating this Warning level displays in the example graph.
. For the _Critical_ level, enter 400. The dashed line indicating this Critical level displays in the example graph.
+
The graph displays historical data. The Warning and Critical level lines on the graph are a visual representation of the Monitor, so you can easily see when the Monitor might trigger an alert in each case. 

. For the occurence interval, choose _Continuously_ for a period of _15 Minutes_.
+
You can choose to trigger an alert the moment a threshold is breached, or wait until the threshold has been in continuous breach for a period of time. In our example, we do not want to be alerted every time the Total IOPS peaks above the Warning or Critical level, but only when a monitored object continuously exceeds one of these levels for at least 15 minutes.

=== Setting Corrective Actions or Additional Information

You can add an optional description as well as additional insights and/or corrective actions by filling in the *Add an Alert Description* section. The description can be up to 1024 characters and will be sent with the alert. The insights/corrective action field can be up to 67,000 characters and will be displayed in the summary section of the alert landing page.

In these fields you can provide notes, links, or steps to take to correct or otherwise address the alert.

=== Select notification type and recipients

In the _Set up team notification(s)_ section, you can choose whether to alert your team via email or Webhook.

image:Webhook_Choose_Monitor_Notification.png[Choose alerting method]

*Alerting via Email:*

Specify the email recipients for alert notifications. If desired, you can choose different recipients for warning or critical alerts.

image:email_monitor_alerts.png[Email Alert Recipients]

*Alerting via Webhook:*

Specify the webhook(s) for alert notifications. If desired, you can choose different webhooks for warning or critical alerts.

image:Webhook_Monitor_Notifications.png[Webhook Alerting]

NOTE: Webhooks is considered a Preview feature and is therefore subject to change.

=== Save your Monitor

. If desired, you can add a description of the monitor. 
+
. Give the Monitor a meaningful name and click *Save*.
+
Your new monitor is added to the list of active Monitors.

=== Monitor List

The Monitor page lists the currently configured monitors, showing the following:

* Monitor Name
* Status 
* Object/metric being monitored
* Conditions of the Monitor

You can choose to temporarily suspend monitoring of an object type by clicking the menu to the right of the monitor and selecting *Pause*. When you are ready to resume monitoring, click *Resume*.

You can copy a monitor by selecting *Duplicate* from the menu. You can then modify the new monitor and change the object/metric, filter, conditions, email recipients, etc.

If a monitor is no longer needed, you can delete it by selecting *Delete* from the menu.


== Monitor Groups

Grouping allows you to view and manage related monitors. For example, you can have a monitor group dedicated to the storage in your environment, or monitors relevant to a certain recipient list. 

//image:Monitors_GroupList.png[Monitor Grouping]
image:Monitors_Custom_System.png[Monitor Groups List]

Monitors are grouped in the following categories:

* *All Monitors*: All monitors, both user-created and system-defined
* *Custom Monitors*: Includes user-created monitors
* *System Monitor groups*: These groups include system-defined monitors, which are based on the data collectors in your environment
* *User-Created Monitor groups*: These are monitor groups you create

The number of monitors contained in a group is shown next to the group name.

NOTE: Custom monitors can be pasued, resumed, deleted, or moved to another group. System-defined monitors can be paused and resumed but can not be deleted or moved.

To create a new group, click the *"+" Create New Monitor Group* button. Enter a name for the group and click *Create Group*. An empty group is created with that name. 

To add monitors to the group, go to the _All Monitors_ group (recommended) and do one of the following:

* To add a single monitor, click the menu to the right of the monitor and select _Add to Group_. Choose the group to which to add the monitor.
* Click on the monitor name to open the monitor's edit view, and select a group in the _Associate to a monitor group_ section.
+
image:Monitors_AssociateToGroup.png[Associate to group]

//* To add multiple monitors to a group, select them by clicking the checkbox next to each monitor, then click the *Bulk Actions* button and select _Move to Group_.

Remove monitors by clicking on a group and selecting _Remove from Group_ from the menu. You can not remove monitors from the _All Monitors or _Custom Monitors_ group. To delete a monitor from these groups, you must delete the monitor itself.

NOTE: Removing a monitor from a group does not delete the monitor from Cloud Insights. To completely remove a monitor, select the monitor and click _Delete_. This also removes it from the group to which it belonged and it is no longer available to any user.

You can also move a monitor to a different group in the same manner, selecting _Move to Group_. 

NOTE: Each monitor can belong to only a single group at any given time.

To pause or resume all monitors in a group at once, select the menu for the group and click _Pause_ or _Resume_. 

Use the same menu to rename or delete a group. Deleting a group does not delete the monitors from Cloud Insights; they are still available in _All Monitors_.

== Pin your Favorite monitors

You can further manage your monitors by pinning favorite ones to the top of your monitor list. To pin a monitor, simply click the thumbtack button displayed when you hover over a monitor in any list. 

// Pinning a monitor pins it to the top of the current group, as well as any other groups containing that monitor, including _All monitors_.

Monitor pin/unpin is an individual user preference and independent of the group (or groups) to which the monitor belongs.
