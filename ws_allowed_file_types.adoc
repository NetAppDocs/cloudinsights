If a ransomware attack is detected for a known file extension, and alerts are being generated on the Alerts screen, then that file extension can be added to an _allowed file types_ list to prevent unnecessary alerting.

Navigate to *Workload Security > Policies* and go to the _Allowed File Type Policies_ tab.

Once added to the _allowed file types_ list, no ransomware attack alert will be generated for that allowed file type. Note that the _Allowed File Types_ policy is only applicable for ransomware detection.

For example, if a file named _test.txt_ is renamed to _test.txt.abc_ and Workload Security is detecting a ransomware attack because of the _.abc_ extension, the _.abc_ extension can be added to the _allowed file types_ list. After being added to the list, ransomware attacks will no longer be generated against files with the _.abc_ extension.

Allowed File Types can be exact matches (e.g., ".abc") or expressions (e.g., ".*type", ".type*", or "*type*"). Expressions of types “.a*c”, “.p*f” are not supported.
