If you have an agent already configured, select the appropriate Operating System or Platform and click *Continue*.

. Follow the instructions in the HTTP Configuration screen to configure the data collector. The instructions vary depending on the type of Operating System or Platform you are using to collect data. The example below shows the instructions for macOS:
