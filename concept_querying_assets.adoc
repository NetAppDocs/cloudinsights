Queries enable you to monitor and troubleshoot your network by searching the assets and metrics in your environment at a granular level based on user-selected criteria (for example, annotations). 

Note that annotation rules, which automatically assign annotations to assets, _require_ a query.

You can query the physical or virtual inventory assets (and their associated metrics) in your environment, or the metrics provided with integration such as Kubernetes or ONTAP Advanced Data.

== Inventory Assets

The following asset types can be used in queries, dashboard widgets, and custom asset landing pages. The fields and counters available for filters, expressions, and display will vary among asset types. Not all assets can be used in all widget types.

* Application
* Datastore
* Disk
* Fabric
* Generic Device
* Host
* Internal Volume
* iSCSI Session
* iSCSI Network Portal
* Path
* Port
* Qtree
* Quota
* Share
* Storage
* Storage Node
* Storage Pool
* Storage Virtual Machine (SVM)
* Switch
* Tape
* VMDK
* Virtual Machine
* Volume
* Zone
* Zone Member

== Integration Metrics

In addition to querying for inventory assets and their associated performance metrics, you can query for *integration data* metrics as well, such as those generated by Kubernetes or Docker, or provided with ONTAP Advanced Metrics.
