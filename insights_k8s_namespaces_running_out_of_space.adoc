Running out of space in your environment is never a good situation. Cloud Insights helps you predict the time you have before Kubernetes spaces become full.

NOTE: This is a _Preview_ feature and may change over time as improvements are made. link:/concept_preview_features.html[Learn more] about Cloud Insights Preview features.

The _Kubernetes Running Out of Space_ Insight gives you a view into workloads on your Kubernetes namespaces that are at risk of running out of space, with an estimate for the number of days remaining before each space becomes full.

You can view this Insight by navigating to *Dashboards > Insights*.
