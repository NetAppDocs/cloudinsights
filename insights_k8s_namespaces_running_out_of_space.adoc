Running out of space is a situation you want to avoid in your enterprise. Cloud Insights helps you predict the time you have before a Kubernetes space becomes full.

NOTE: This is a _Preview_ feature and may change over time as improvements are made. link:/concept_preview_features.html[Learn more] about Cloud Insights Preview features.

The _Kubernetes Running Out of Space_ Insight gives you a view into workloads on your Kubernetes namespaces that are at risk of running out of space, with a prediction for the number of days until that time.

You can view this Insight by navigating to *Dashboards > Insights*.
