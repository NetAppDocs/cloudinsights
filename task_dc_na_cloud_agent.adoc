This data collector creates a cloud connection to support data collection from ONTAP 9.9+ systems. 


== Configuration

Configuration of the Cloud Connection for ONTAP 9.9+ data collector requires you to copy a Pairing Code to the ONTAP System Manager, which will then establish a connection to your Cloud Insights environment. 

NOTE: Starting with ONTAP 9.9+, data collection no longer requires a traditional acquisition unit. Data is instead collected using the cloud connection, eliminating the need to install an external acquisition unit.

Follow these steps to configure the connection:

* Generate a unique token which will be used to establish the connection to the ONTAP system.

* Copy the Pairing Code, which includes the token. You can view the pairing code by clicking on _[+] Reveal Code Snippet_.
+
Once you copy the pairing code, the data collector configuration screen will reveal a step 6, prompting you to wait for the connection to be established. Nothing more needs to be done on this screen until the connection is established.

* In a new browser tab, log into the ONTAP System Manager and navigate to _Cluster > Settings > Cloud Connections_.

* Click _Add Cloud Connection_ and paste the pairing code.

* Return to the Cloud Insights browser tab and wait for the connection to be established. Once it is established, a _Complete_ button is revealed.

* Click _Complete_.
