After adding a new data collector, Cloud Insights initiates three polls:

* 1st inventory poll: immediately 
* 1st performance data poll to establish a baseline: immediately after inventory poll
* 2nd performance poll: within 15 seconds after completion of 1st performance poll

Polling then proceeds according to the configured inventory and performance poll intervals.
