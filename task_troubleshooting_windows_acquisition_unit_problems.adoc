Here you will find suggestions for troubleshooting problems with Acquisition Units on a Windows server. 

|===
|*Problem:* | *Try this:* 
|AU status on the *Admin > Data Collectors* page in the *Acquisition Units* tab displays "Certificate Expired” or “Certificate Revoked” .
|Click on the menu to the right of the AU and select *Restore Connection*. Follow the instructions to restore your Acquisition Unit:

1. Stop the Acquisition Unit (AU) service. You can click the _Copy Stop Command_ button to quickly copy the command to the clipboard, then paste this command into a command prompt on the acquisition unit machine.

2. Create a file named "token" in the _c:\Program Files\Cloud Insights\Acquisition Unit\conf\_ folder on the AU. 

3. Click the _Copy Token_ button, and paste this token into the file you created. 

4. Restart the AU service. Click the _Copy Restart Command_ button, and paste the command into a command prompt on the AU.

|Server Requirements not met | Ensure that your Acquisition Unit server or VM meets link:concept_acquisition_unit_requirements.html[requirements]

|Network Requirements not met |Ensure that your Acquisition Unit server/VM can access your Cloud Insights environment (<environment-name>.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com) through SSL connection over port 443. Try the following commands:

 _ping <environment-name>.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com_
_traceroute <environment-name>.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com_
_curl \https://<environment-name>.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com_
_wget \https://<environment-name>.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com_

|Proxy Server not configured properly | Verify your proxy settings, and uninstall/re-install the Acquisition Unit software if necessary to enter the correct proxy settings. 

1. Try "curl".  Refer to "man curl" information/documentation regarding proxies: --preproxy, --proxy-* (that's a wildcard "*" because curl supports many proxy settings).
2. Try "wget".  Check documentation for proxy options.


|Acquisition unit installation failed in Cloud insights with credential errors while starting acquisition service (and visible in the acq.log).|This can be caused by the inclusion of special characters in the proxy credentials. Uninstall the AU (_sudo cloudinsights-uninstall.sh_) and reinstall without using special characters.

|Permission issues| Be sure you are logged in as a user with administrator permissions

|Acquisition Not Running
|You can find information in the acq.log in the _<install directory>\Cloud Insights\Acquisition Unit\log_ folder.
Restart the Acquisition via Windows Services

|Data Collection Issues
|Send an Error Report from the Data Collector landing page by clicking the "Send Error Report" button

|Status: Heartbeat Failed
|The Acquisition Unit (AU) sends a heartbeat to Cloud Insights every 60 seconds to renew its lease. If the heartbeat call fails due to network issue or unresponsive Cloud Insights, the AU's lease time isn't updated. When the AU's lease time expires, the Cloud Insights shows a status of "Heartbeat Failed".

=== Considerations about Proxies and Firewalls

If your organization requires proxy usage for internet access, you may need to understand your organization’s proxy behavior and seek certain exceptions for Cloud Insights to work. Keep the following in mind:

* First, does your organization block access by default, and only allow access to specific web sites/domains by exception? If so, you will need to add the following domain to your exception list:
+
 *.cloudinsights.netapp.com
+
Your Cloud Insights Acquisition Unit, as well as your interactions in a web browser with Cloud Insights, will all go to hosts with that domain name. 

* Second, some proxies attempt to perform TLS/SSL inspection by impersonating Cloud Insights web sites with digital certificates not generated from NetApp. The Cloud Insights Acquisition Unit’s security model is fundamentally incompatible with these technologies. You would also need the above domain name excepted from this functionality in order for the Cloud Insights Acquisition Unit to successfully login to Cloud Insights and facilitate data discovery.
