== Editing an existing report

Be aware that editing files in their default location runs a risk of those reports being overwritten upon the next report catalog refresh. It is recommended to save the edited report under a new name or store it in a non-default location.


== Troubleshooting

Here you will find suggestions for troubleshooting problems with Reporting. 

|===
|*Problem:* |*Try this:* 
|When scheduling a report to be sent via email, the name of the user logged in is pre-populated to the email's “To” field. However, the name is in the form of "firstname lastname" (first name, space, last name). Since this is not a valid email address, the email will fail to send when the scheduled report is run.
|When scheduling the report to be sent via email, clear the pre-populated name and enter a valid, properly-formatted email address in the “To” field.
