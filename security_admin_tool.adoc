Cloud Insights Includes security features that allow your environment to operate with enhanced security. The features include improvements to encryption, password hashing, and the ability to change internal user passwords as well as key pairs that encrypt and decrypt passwords. 

To protect sensitive data, NetApp recommends you change the default keys and the _Acquisition_ user password after an installation or upgrade.

Data source encrypted passwords are stored in Cloud Insights, which uses a a public key to encrypt passwords when a user enters them in a data collector configuration page. Cloud Insights does not have the private keys required to decrypt the data collector passwords; only Acquisition Units (AUs) have the data collector private key required to decrypt data collector passwords.  


== Upgrade and installation considerations

When your Insight system contains non-default security configurations (i.e. you have rekeyed passwords), you must back up your security configurations. Installing new software, or in some cases upgrading software, reverts your system to a default security configuration. When your system reverts to the default configuration, you must restore the non-default configuration in order for the system to operate correctly.

== Managing security on the acquisition unit

The SecurityAdmin tool allows you to manage security options for Cloud Insights, and is run on the acquisition unit system. Security management includes managing keys and passwords, saving and restoring security configurations you create or restoring configurations to the default settings.

== Before you begin

* You must have admin privileges on the AU system in order to install the Acquisition Unit software (which includes the SecurityAdmin tool).
* If you have non-admin users who will subsequently need to access the SecurityAdmin tool, they must be added to the _cisys_ group. The _cisys_ group is created during AU installation. 

After AU install, the SecurityAdmin tool is found on the acquisition unit system at either of these locations:

 Windows - C:\Program Files\SANscreen\securityadmin\bin\securityadmin.bat
 Linux - /bin/oci-securityadmin.sh

== Using the SecurityAdmin Tool

Start the SecurityAdmin tool in interactive mode (-i).

NOTE: It is recommended to use the SecurityAdmin tool in interactive mode, to avoid passing secrets on the command line, which can be captured in logs. 

The following options are displayed:

image:SecurityAdminMenuChoices.png[Options for SecurityAdmin Tool (Linux)]

. *Backup*

+
Creates a backup zip file of the vault containing all passwords and keys and places the file in a location specified by the user, or in the following default locations:
+
 Windows - C:\Program Files\SANscreen\backup\vault
 Linux - /var/log/netapp/oci/backup/vault
+
It is recommended that vault backups be kept secure, as they include sensitive information.

. *Restore*
+
Restores the zip backup of the vault that was created. Once restored, all passwords and keys are reverted to values existing at the time of the backup creation.
+
Restore can be used to synchronize passwords and keys on multiple servers, for example using these steps: 1) Change encryption keys on the AU. 2) Create a backup of the vault. 3) Restore the vault backup to each of the AUs.

. *Register / Update External Key Retrieval Script*
+
Use an external script to register or change the AU encryption keys used to encrypt or decrypt device passwords.
+
When you change encryption keys, you should back up your new security configuration so that you can restore it after an upgrade or installation.
+
Note this option is only available on Linux.
+
When using your own key retrieval script with the SecurityAdmin tool, keep the following in mind:

* The current supported Algorithm is RSA with minimum 2048 bits.  
* The script must return the private and public keys in plain text. The script must not return encrypted private and public keys. 
* The script should return raw, encoded contents (PEM format only). 
* The external script must have _execute_ permissions.

. *Rotate Encryption Keys*
+
Rotate your encryption keys (un-registers current keys and registers new keys). To use a key from an external key management system, you must specify the public key id and private key id.


////

* Update Password
+
Change password for 'acquisition' user account.
+
When you change passwords, you should back up your new security configuration so that you can restore it if necessary.
////

. *Reset to Default Keys*
+
Resets acquisition user password and acquisition user encryption keys to default values, Default values are those provided during installation.

. *Change Truststore Password*
+
Change the password of the truststore.

. *Change Keystore Password*
+
Change the password of the keystore.

. *Encrypt Collector Password*
+
Encrypt data collector password.

. *Exit*

+
Exit the SecurityAdmin tool.

Chose the option you want to configure and follow the prompts.


== Specifying a user to run the tool

If you are in a controlled, security-conscious environment, you may not have the _cisys_ group but may still want specific users to run the SecurityAdmin tool.

You can achieve this by manually installing the AU software and specifying the user/group for whom you want access.

* Using the API, download the CI Installer to the AU system and unzip it.

** You will need a one-time authorization token. See the API Swagger documentation (_Admin > API Access_ and select the _API Documentation_ link) and find the _GET /au/oneTimeToken_ API section.
** Once you have the token, use the _GET /au/installers/{platform}/{version}_ API to download the installer file. You will need to provide platform (Linux or Windows) as well as installer version.

* Copy the downloaded installer file to the AU system and unzip it.

* Navigate to the folder containing the files, and run the installer as root, specifying the user and group:

 ./cloudinsights-install.sh <User> <Group>  

If the specified user and/or group do not exist, they will be created. The user will have access to the SecurityAdmin tool.



== Updating or Removing Proxy

The SecurityAdmin tool can be used to set or remove proxy information for the Acquisition Unit by running the tool with the _-pr_ parameter: 

----
[root@ci-eng-linau bin]# ./securityadmin -pr
usage: securityadmin -pr -ap <arg> | -h | -rp | -upr <arg>

The purpose of this tool is to enable reconfiguration of security aspects
of the Acquisition Unit such as encryption keys, and proxy configuration,
etc. For more information about this tool, please check the Cloud Insights
Documentation.

-ap,--add-proxy <arg>       add a proxy server.  Arguments: ip=ip
                             port=port user=user password=password
                             domain=domain
                             (Note: Always use double quote(") or single
                             quote(') around user and password to escape
                             any special characters, e.g., <, >, ~, `, ^,
                             !
                             For example: user="test" password="t'!<@1"
                             Note: domain is required if the proxy auth
                             scheme is NTLM.)
-h,--help
-rp,--remove-proxy          remove proxy server
-upr,--update-proxy <arg>   update a proxy.  Arguments: ip=ip port=port
                             user=user password=password domain=domain
                             (Note: Always use double quote(") or single
                             quote(') around user and password to escape
                             any special characters, e.g., <, >, ~, `, ^,
                             !
                             For example: user="test" password="t'!<@1"
                             Note: domain is required if the proxy auth
                             scheme is NTLM.)
----

For example, to remove the proxy, run this command:

 [root@ci-eng-linau bin]# ./securityadmin -pr -rp

You must restart the Acquisition Unit after running the command.

To update a proxy, the command is  

 ./securityadmin -pr -upr <arg> 
 


== Encrypting a Password for use in API

Option 8 allows you to encrypt a password, which you can then pass to a data collector via API.

Start the SecurityAdmin tool in interactive mode and select option 8: _Encrypt Password_.

 securityadmin.sh -i

You are prompted to enter the password you want to encrypt. Note that the characters you type are not shown on screen.  Re-enter the password when prompted.

Alternatively, if you will use the command in a script, on a command line use _securityadmin.sh_ with the "-enc" parameter, passing in your unencrypted password:

 securityadmin -enc mypassword

image:SecurityAdmin_Encrypt_Key_API_CLI_Example.png[CLI Example]

The encrypted password is displayed on screen. Copy the entire string including any leading or trailing symbols.

image:SecurityAdmin_Encrypt_Key_1.png[Interactive Mode Encrypt Password, width=640]

To send the encrypted password to a data collector, you can use the Data Collection API. The swagger for this API can be found at *Admin > API Access* and click the "API Documentation" link. Select the "Data Collection" API type.  Under the _data_collection.data_collector_ heading, choose the _/collector/datasources_ POST API for this example.

image:SecurityAdmin_Encrypt_Key_Swagger_API.png[API for data collection]

If you set the _preEncrypted_ option to _True_, any password you pass through the API command will be treated as *already encrypted*; the API will not re-encrypt the password(s). When building your API, simply paste the previously-encrypted password in the appropriate location.
