The EMC RecoverPoint data collector's primary use case is to discover volume-to-volume replication relationships that the RecoverPoint storage appliance facilitates. This collector will also discover the Recoverpoint appliance itself. Please note that Dell/EMC sells a VMware backup solution for VMs--"RecoverPoint for VMs"--which is not supported by this collector

For configuration, the data collector requires the IP address of the storage processors and a read-only user name and password.


The EMC RecoverPoint data collector gathers the volume-to-volume replication relationships that RecoverPoint coordinates across other storage arrays. Cloud Insights shows a storage array for each RecoverPoint cluster, and collects inventory data for nodes and storage ports on that cluster. No storage pool or volume data is collected. 

== Requirements

The following information is required to configure this data collector:

* IP address or fully-qualified domain name of storage processor
