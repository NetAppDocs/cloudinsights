Cloud Insights includes a number of system-defined monitors for both metrics and logs. The system monitors available are dependent on the data collectors present in your environment. Because of that, the monitors available in Cloud Insights may change as data collectors are added or their configurations changed.

NOTE: Most System Monitors are in _Paused_ state by default. Before resuming the monitor, you must ensure that _Advanced Counter Data Collection_ and _Enable ONTAP EMS log collection_ are enabled in the Data Collector. These options can be found in the ONTAP Data Collector under _Advanced Configuration_:

//NOTE: Since System-Defined monitors are a Preview feature, they are subject to change.

////
== Create the Monitor 

. From the Cloud Insights menu, click *Alerts > Manage Monitors*
+
The Monitors list page is displayed, showing currently configured monitors. 

. To modify an existing monitor, click the monitor name in the list.

. To add a monitor, Click *+ Monitor*. 
+
image:Monitor_log_or_metric.png[Choose system or log monitor]
+
When you add a new monitor, you are prompted to create a Metric Monitor or a Log Monitor.

* _Metric_ monitors alert on infrastructure- or performance-related triggers
* _Log_ monitors alert on log-related activity

+
After you choose your monitor type, the Monitor Configuration dialog is displayed.


==== Metric Monitor

. In the drop-down, search for and choose an object type and metric to monitor.

You can set filters to narrow down which object attributes or metrics to monitor. 

//image:select_metric_to_monitor.png[Select Metric]

image:MonitorMetricFilter.png[Metrics Filtering]

//When working with integration data (Kubernetes, ONTAP Advanced Data, etc.), metric filtering works against the data samples themselves, not the objects as with infrastructure data (storage, VMs, ports, etc.).

When working with integration data (Kubernetes, ONTAP Advanced Data, etc.), metric filtering removes the individual/unmatched data points from the plotted data series, unlike infrastructure data (storage, VM, ports etc.) where filters work on the aggregated value of the data series and potentially remove the entire object from the chart. 

//image:IntegrationMetricFilterExample.png[Integration Metric Filtering]

TIP: To create a multi-condition monitor (e.g., IOPS > X and latency > Y), define the first condition as a threshold and the second condition as a filter.


===== Define the Conditions of the Monitor. 

. After choosing the object and metric to monitor, set the Warning-level and/or Critical-level thresholds.
. For the _Warning_ level, enter 200 for our example. The dashed line indicating this Warning level displays in the example graph.
. For the _Critical_ level, enter 400. The dashed line indicating this Critical level displays in the example graph.
+
The graph displays historical data. The Warning and Critical level lines on the graph are a visual representation of the Monitor, so you can easily see when the Monitor might trigger an alert in each case. 

. For the occurence interval, choose _Continuously_ for a period of _15 Minutes_.
+
You can choose to trigger an alert the moment a threshold is breached, or wait until the threshold has been in continuous breach for a period of time. In our example, we do not want to be alerted every time the Total IOPS peaks above the Warning or Critical level, but only when a monitored object continuously exceeds one of these levels for at least 15 minutes.
+
//image:define_monitor_conditions.png[Define Conditions]
image:Monitor_metric_conditions.png[Define the monitor's conditions]


=== Log Monitor

When creating a *Log monitor*, first choose which log to monitor from the available log list. You can then filter based on the available attributes as above.

For example, you might choose to filter for "object.store.unavailable" message type in the logs.netapp.ems source:

NOTE: The Log Monitor filter cannot be empty. 

image:Monitor_log_monitor_filter.png[choose which log to monitor, and set a filter]



==== Define the alert behavior

Choose how you want to alert when a log alert is triggered. You can set the monitor to alert with _Warning_, _Critical_, or _Informational_ severity, based on the filter conditions you set above.

image:Monitor_log_alert_behavior.png[define the log behavior to monitor]


==== Define the alert resolution behavior

You can choose how an log monitor alert is resolved. You are presented with three choices:

* *Resolve instantly*: The alert is immediately resolved with no further action needed
* *Resolve based on time*: The alert is resolved after the specified time has passed
* *Resolve based on log entry*: The alert is resolved when a subsequent log activity has occurred. For example, when an object is logged as "available".

image:Monitor_log_monitor_resolution.png[Alert Resolution]



==== Select notification type and recipients

In the _Set up team notification(s)_ section, you can choose whether to alert your team via email or Webhook.

image:Webhook_Choose_Monitor_Notification.png[Choose alerting method]

*Alerting via Email:*

Specify the email recipients for alert notifications. If desired, you can choose different recipients for warning or critical alerts.

image:email_monitor_alerts.png[Email Alert Recipients]

*Alerting via Webhook:*

Specify the webhook(s) for alert notifications. If desired, you can choose different webhooks for warning or critical alerts.

image:Webhook_Monitor_Notifications.png[Webhook Alerting]


==== Setting Corrective Actions or Additional Information

You can add an optional description as well as additional insights and/or corrective actions by filling in the *Add an Alert Description* section. The description can be up to 1024 characters and will be sent with the alert. The insights/corrective action field can be up to 67,000 characters and will be displayed in the summary section of the alert landing page.

In these fields you can provide notes, links, or steps to take to correct or otherwise address the alert.

image:Monitors_Alert_Description.png[Alert Corrective Actions and Description]


==== Save your Monitor

. If desired, you can add a description of the monitor. 
+
. Give the Monitor a meaningful name and click *Save*.
+
Your new monitor is added to the list of active Monitors.

==== Monitor List

The Monitor page lists the currently configured monitors, showing the following:

* Monitor Name
* Status 
* Object/metric being monitored
* Conditions of the Monitor

You can choose to temporarily pause monitoring of an object type by clicking the menu to the right of the monitor and selecting *Pause*. When you are ready to resume monitoring, click *Resume*.

You can copy a monitor by selecting *Duplicate* from the menu. You can then modify the new monitor and change the object/metric, filter, conditions, email recipients, etc.

If a monitor is no longer needed, you can delete it by selecting *Delete* from the menu.
////

////
== Monitor Groups

Grouping allows you to view and manage related monitors. For example, you can have a monitor group dedicated to the storage in your environment, or monitors relevant to a certain recipient list. 

image:Monitors_GroupList.png[Monitor Grouping]
////

////

Two groups are shown by default:

* *All Monitors* lists all monitors.
* *Custom Monitors* lists only user-created monitors.
////

////
The number of monitors contained in a group is shown next to the group name.


NOTE: Custom monitors can be paused, resumed, deleted, or moved to another group. System-defined monitors can be paused and resumed but can not be deleted or moved.


=== Custom Monitor Groups

To create a new custom monitor group, click the *"+" Create New Monitor Group* button. Enter a name for the group and click *Create Group*. An empty group is created with that name. 


To add monitors to the group, go to the _All Monitors_ group (recommended) and do one of the following:

* To add a single monitor, click the menu to the right of the monitor and select _Move to Group_. Choose the group to which to add the monitor.
* To add multiple monitors, select the ones you want to move, and click _Bulk Actions_. Choose _Move to group_. You cannot move system-defined monitors.
* Click on the monitor name to open the monitor's edit view, and select a group in the _Associate to a monitor group_ section.
+
image:Monitors_AssociateToGroup.png[Associate to group]

//* To add multiple monitors to a group, select them by clicking the checkbox next to each monitor, then click the *Bulk Actions* button and select _Move to Group_.

Remove monitors by clicking on a group and selecting _Remove from Group_ from the menu. You can not remove monitors from the _All Monitors_ or _Custom Monitors_ group, or from any of the system-defined monitor groups. To delete a monitor from these groups, you must delete the monitor itself.

//To remove a monitor from a group while editing the monitor, in the _Associate with a group_ section, click the *X* next to the group name.

NOTE: Removing a monitor from a group does not delete the monitor from Cloud Insights. To completely remove a monitor, select the monitor and click _Delete_. This also removes it from any group to which it belonged and it is no longer available to any user.

You can also move a monitor to a different group in the same manner, selecting _Move to Group_. You cannot move monitors from the system-defined monitor groups; to move a monitor from one of these groups, you must first _Duplicate_ the monitor, and then move the duplicated monitor to the desired group.

To pause or resume all monitors in a group at once, select the menu for the group and click _Pause_ or _Resume_. 

Use the same menu to rename or delete a group. Deleting a group does not delete the monitors from Cloud Insights; they are still available in _All Monitors_. You cannot delete system-defined monitor groups.

image:Monitors_PauseGroup.png[Pause a group]

== Monitor Descriptions

System-defined monitors are comprised of pre-defined metrics and conditions, as well as default descriptions and corrective actions, which can not be modified. You _can_ modify the notification recipient list for system-defined monitors. To view the metrics, conditions, description and corrective actions, or to modify the recipient list, open a system-defined monitor group and click the monitor name in the list.

System-defined monitor groups cannot be modified or removed.

The following system-defined monitors are available, in the noted groups.

* *ONTAP Infrastructure* includes monitors for infrastructure-related issues in ONTAP clusters. 
* *ONTAP Workload Examples* includes monitors for workload-related issues. 
* Monitors in both group default to _Paused_ state.

Below are the system monitors currently included with Cloud Insights:

|Snapshot Reserve Space Full|CRITICAL|Storage capacity of a volume is necessary to store application and customer data. A portion of that space, called snapshot reserved space, is used to store snapshots which allow data to be protected locally. The more new and updated data stored in the ONTAP volume the more snapshot capacity is used and less snapshot storage capacity is available for future new or updated data. If the snapshot data capacity within a volume reaches the total snapshot reserve space, it might lead to the customer being unable to store new snapshot data and reduction in the level of protection for the data in the volume.

Monitor Name|Description|Corrective Action
|Acquisition Unit Shutdown|Cloud Insights Acquisition Units periodically restart as part of upgrades to introduce new features. This happens once a month or less in a typical environment. A Warning Alert that an Acquisition Unit has shutdown should be followed soon after by a Resolution noting that the newly-restarted Acquisition Unit has completed a registration with Cloud Insights. Typically this shutdown-to-registration cycle takes 5 to 15 minutes. |If the alert occurs frequently or lasts longer than 15 minutes, check on the operation of the system hosting the Acquisition Unit, the network, and any proxy connecting the AU to the Internet.
|Collector Failed|The poll of a data collector encountered an unexpected failure situation.|Visit the data collector page in Cloud Insights to learn more about the situation.
|Collector Warning|This Alert typically can arise because of an erroneous configuration of the data collector or of the target system. Revisit the configurations to prevent future Alerts. It can also be due to a retrieval of less-than-complete data where the data collector gathered all the data that it could. This can happen when situations change during data collection (e.g., a virtual machine present at the beginning of data collection is deleted during data collection and before its data is captured).|Check the configuration of the data collector or target system.

Note that the monitor for Collector Warning can send more alerts than other monitor types, so it is recommended to set no alert recipients unless you are troubleshooting.

=== Data Protection Monitors

|===

|Monitor Name|Thresholds|Monitor Description|Corrective Action
|Insufficient Space for Lun Snapshot Copy|(Filter contains_luns = Yes) Warning @ > 95 %…Critical @ > 100 %|Storage capacity of a volume is necessary to store application and customer data. A portion of that space, called snapshot reserved space, is used to store snapshots which allow data to be protected locally. The more new and updated data stored in the ONTAP volume the more snapshot capacity is used and less snapshot storage capacity will be available for future new or updated data. If the snapshot data capacity within a volume reaches the total snapshot reserve space it may lead to the customer being unable to store new snapshot data and reduction in the level of protection for the data in the LUNs in the volume. Monitoring the volume used snapshot capacity ensures data services continuity.| **Immediate Actions**
If critical threshold is breached, consider immediate actions to minimize service disruption:

1. Configure snapshots to use data space in the volume when the snapshot reserve is full.
2. Delete some older unwanted snapshots to free up space.
 
**Actions To Do Soon**
If warning threshold is breached, plan to take the following immediate actions:

1. Increase the snapshot reserve space within the volume to accommodate the growth.
2. Configure snapshots to use data space in the volume when the snapshot reserve is full.
|SnapMirror Relationship Lag|Warning @ > 150%…Critical @ >  300%|SnapMirror relationship lag is the difference between the snapshot timestamp and the time on the destination system. The lag_time_percent is the ratio of lag time to the SnapMirror Policy's schedule interval. If the lag time equals the schedule interval, the lag_time_percent will be 100%. If the SnapMirror policy does not have a schedule, lag_time_percent will not be calculated.|Monitor SnapMirror status using the "snapmirror show" command. Check the SnapMirror transfer history using the "snapmirror show-history" command

|Monitor Name|Severity|Monitor Description|Corrective Action
|CVO Disk Out of Service|INFO|This event occurs when a disk is removed from service because it has been marked failed, is being sanitized, or has entered the Maintenance Center.|None
|CVO Giveback of Storage Pool Failed|CRITICAL|This event occurs during the migration of an aggregate as part of a storage failover (SFO) giveback, when the destination node cannot reach the object stores.|Perform the following corrective actions:…Verify that your intercluster LIF is online and functional by using the "network interface show" command.…Check network connectivity to the object store server by using the"'ping" command over the destination node intercluster LIF.…Verify that the configuration of your object store has not changed and that login and connectivity information is still accurate by using the "aggregate object-store config show" command.…Alternatively, you can override the error by specifying false for the "require-partner-waiting" parameter of the giveback command.…Contact NetApp technical support for more information or assistance.
|CVO HA Interconnect Down|WARNING|The high-availability (HA) interconnect is down. Risk of service outage when failover is not available.|Corrective actions depend on the number and type of HA interconnect links supported by the platform, as well as the reason why the interconnect is down. …If the links are down:…Verify that both controllers in the HA pair are operational.…For externally connected links, make sure that the interconnect cables are connected properly and that the small form-factor pluggables (SFPs), if applicable, are seated properly on both controllers.…For internally connected links, disable and re-enable the links, one after the other, by using the "ic link off" and "ic link on" commands. …If links are disabled, enable the links by using the "ic link on" command. …If a peer is not connected, disable and re-enable the links, one after the other, by using the "ic link off" and "ic link on" commands.…Contact NetApp technical support if the issue persists.
|CVO Max Sessions Per User Exceeded|WARNING…|You have exceeded the maximum number of sessions allowed per user over a TCP connection. Any request to establish a session will be denied until some sessions are released. …|Perform the following corrective actions: …Inspect all the applications that run on the client, and terminate any that are not operating properly.…Reboot the client.…Check if the issue is caused by a new or existing application:…If the application is new, set a higher threshold for the client by using the "cifs option modify -max-opens-same-file-per-tree" command.
In some cases, clients operate as expected, but require a higher threshold. You should have advanced privilege to set a higher threshold for the client. …If the issue is caused by an existing application, there might be an issue with the client. Contact NetApp technical support for more information or assistance.
|CVO NetBIOS Name Conflict|CRITICAL…|The NetBIOS Name Service has received a negative response to a name registration request, from a remote machine. This is typically caused by a conflict in the NetBIOS name or an alias. As a result, clients might not be able to access data or connect to the right data-serving node in the cluster.|•|Perform any one of the following corrective actions:…If there is a conflict in the NetBIOS name or an alias, perform one of the following:…Delete the duplicate NetBIOS alias by using the "vserver cifs delete -aliases alias -vserver vserver" command.…Rename a NetBIOS alias by deleting the duplicate name and adding an alias with a new name by using the "vserver cifs create -aliases alias -vserver vserver" command. …If there are no aliases configured and there is a conflict in the NetBIOS name, then rename the CIFS server by using the "vserver cifs delete -vserver vserver" and "vserver cifs create -cifs-server netbiosname" commands.
NOTE: Deleting a CIFS server can make data inaccessible. …Remove NetBIOS name or rename the NetBIOS on the remote machine.
|CVO NFSv4 Store Pool Exhausted|CRITICAL|A NFSv4 store pool has been exhausted.|If the NFS server is unresponsive for more than 10 minutes after this event, contact NetApp technical support.
|CVO Node Panic|WARNING|This event is issued when a panic occurs|Contact NetApp customer support.
|CVO Node Root Volume Space Low|CRITICAL|The system has detected that the root volume is dangerously low on space. The node is not fully operational. Data LIFs might have failed over within the cluster, because of which NFS and CIFS access is limited on the node. Administrative capability is limited to local recovery procedures for the node to clear up space on the root volume.|Perform the following corrective actions:…Clear up space on the root volume by deleting old Snapshot copies, deleting files you no longer need from the /mroot directory, or expanding the root volume capacity.…Reboot the controller.…Contact NetApp technical support for more information or assistance.
|CVO Nonexistent Admin Share|CRITICAL|Vscan issue: a client has attempted to connect to a nonexistent ONTAP_ADMIN$ share. |Ensure that Vscan is enabled for the mentioned SVM ID. Enabling Vscan on a SVM causes the ONTAP_ADMIN$ share to be created for the SVM automatically.
|CVO Object Store Host Unresolvable|CRITICAL|The object store server host name cannot be resolved to an IP address. The object store client cannot communicate with the object-store server without resolving to an IP address. As a result, data might be inaccessible. |Check the DNS configuration to verify that the host name is configured correctly with an IP address.
|CVO Object Store Intercluster LIF Down|CRITICAL|The object-store client cannot find an operational LIF to communicate with the object store server. The node will not allow object store client traffic until the intercluster LIF is operational. As a result, data might be inaccessible. |Perform the following corrective actions:…Check the intercluster LIF status by using the "network interface show -role intercluster" command.…Verify that the intercluster LIF is configured correctly and operational.…If an intercluster LIF is not configured, add it by using the "network interface create -role intercluster" command.
|CVO Object Store Signature Mismatch|CRITICAL|The request signature sent to the object store server does not match the signature calculated by the client. As a result, data might be inaccessible. |Verify that the secret access key is configured correctly. If it is configured correctly, contact NetApp technical support for assistance.
|CVO QoS Monitor Memory Maxed Out|CRITICAL|The QoS subsystem's dynamic memory has reached its limit for the current platform hardware. Some QoS features might operate in a limited capacity.|Delete some active workloads or streams to free up memory. Use the “statistics show -object workload -counter ops” command to determine which workloads are active. Active workloads show non-zero ops. Then use the “workload delete <workload_name>” command multiple times to remove specific workloads. Alternatively, use the “stream delete -workload <workload name> *” command to delete the associated streams from the active workload.
|CVO READDIR Timeout|CRITICAL|A READDIR file operation has exceeded the timeout that it is allowed to run in WAFL. This can be because of very large or sparse directories. Corrective action is recommended. |Perform the following corrective actions:…Find information specific to recent directories that have had READDIR file operations expire by using the following 'diag' privilege nodeshell CLI command:
wafl readdir notice show.…Check if directories are indicated as sparse or not:…If a directory is indicated as sparse, it is recommended that you copy the contents of the directory to a new directory to remove the sparseness of the directory file. …If a directory is not indicated as sparse and the directory is large, it is recommended that you reduce the size of the directory file by reducing the number of file entries in the directory.
|CVO Relocation of Storage Pool Failed|CRITICAL|This event occurs during the relocation of an aggregate, when the destination node cannot reach the object stores. |Perform the following corrective actions:…Verify that your intercluster LIF is online and functional by using the "network interface show" command.…Check network connectivity to the object store server by using the"'ping" command over the destination node intercluster LIF. …Verify that the configuration of your object store has not changed and that login and connectivity information is still accurate by using the "aggregate object-store config show" command.…Alternatively, you can override the error by using the "override-destination-checks" parameter of the relocation command.…Contact NetApp technical support for more information or assistance.
|CVO Shadow Copy Failed|CRITICAL|A Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS), a Microsoft Server backup and restore service operation, has failed.|•|Check the following using the information provided in the event message:…Is shadow copy configuration enabled?…Are the appropriate licenses installed? …On which shares is the shadow copy operation performed?…Is the share name correct?…Does the share path exist?…What are the states of the shadow copy set and its shadow copies?
|CVO Storage VM Stop Succeeded|INFO|This message occurs when a 'vserver stop' operation succeeds.|Use 'vserver start' command to start the data access on a storage VM.
|CVO Too Many CIFS Authentication|WARNING|Many authentication negotiations have occurred simultaneously. There are 256 incomplete new session requests from this client.|Investigate why the client has created 256 or more new connection requests. You might have to contact the vendor of the client or of the application to determine why the error occurred.
|CVO Unassigned Disks|INFO|System has unassigned disks - capacity is being wasted and your system may have some misconfiguration or partial configuration change applied.|Perform the following corrective actions:…Determine which disks are unassigned by using the "disk show -n" command.…Assign the disks to a system by using the "disk assign" command.
|CVO Unauthorized User Access to Admin Share|WARNING|A client has attempted to connect to the privileged ONTAP_ADMIN$ share even though their logged-in user is not an allowed user.|Perform the following corrective actions:…Ensure that the mentioned username and IP address is configured in one of the active Vscan scanner pools.…Check the scanner pool configuration that is currently active by using the "vserver vscan scanner pool show-active" command.
|CVO Virus Detected|WARNING|A Vscan server has reported an error to the storage system. This typically indicates that a virus has been found. However, other errors on the Vscan server can cause this event.…Client access to the file is denied. The Vscan server might, depending on its settings and configuration, clean the file, quarantine it, or delete it.|Check the log of the Vscan server reported in the "syslog" event to see if it was able to successfully clean, quarantine, or delete the infected file. If it was not able to do so, a system administrator might have to manually delete the file.
