Data Infrastructure Insights includes a number of system-defined monitors for both metrics and logs. The system monitors available are dependent on the data collectors present on your tenant. Because of that, the monitors available in Data Infrastructure Insights may change as data collectors are added or their configurations changed.

NOTE: Many System Monitors are in _Paused_ state by default. You can enable a system monitor by selecting the _Resume_ option for the monitor. Ensure that _Advanced Counter Data Collection_ and _Enable ONTAP EMS log collection_ are enabled in the Data Collector. These options can be found in the ONTAP Data Collector under _Advanced Configuration_:

== Monitor Descriptions

System-defined monitors are comprised of pre-defined metrics and conditions, as well as default descriptions and corrective actions, which can not be modified. You _can_ modify the notification recipient list for system-defined monitors. To view the metrics, conditions, description and corrective actions, or to modify the recipient list, open a system-defined monitor group and click the monitor name in the list.

System-defined monitor groups cannot be modified or removed.

The following system-defined monitors are available, in the noted groups.

* *ONTAP Infrastructure* includes monitors for infrastructure-related issues in ONTAP clusters. 
* *ONTAP Workload Examples* includes monitors for workload-related issues. 
* Monitors in both group default to _Paused_ state.



Below are the system monitors currently included with Data Infrastructure Insights:

This can happen when situations change during data collection (e.g., a virtual machine present at the beginning of data collection is deleted during data collection and before its data is captured).|Check the configuration of the data collector or target system.

Note that the monitor for Collector Warning can send more alerts than other monitor types, so it is recommended to set no alert recipients unless you are troubleshooting.

=== Data Protection Monitors

|===

|Monitor Name|Thresholds|Monitor Description|Corrective Action
|Insufficient Space for Lun Snapshot Copy|(Filter contains_luns = Yes) Warning @ > 95 %…Critical @ > 100 %|Storage capacity of a volume is necessary to store application and customer data. A portion of that space, called snapshot reserved space, is used to store snapshots which allow data to be protected locally. The more new and updated data stored in the ONTAP volume the more snapshot capacity is used and less snapshot storage capacity will be available for future new or updated data. If the snapshot data capacity within a volume reaches the total snapshot reserve space it may lead to the customer being unable to store new snapshot data and reduction in the level of protection for the data in the LUNs in the volume. Monitoring the volume used snapshot capacity ensures data services continuity.| **Immediate Actions**
If critical threshold is breached, consider immediate actions to minimize service disruption:

1. Configure snapshots to use data space in the volume when the snapshot reserve is full.
2. Delete some older unwanted snapshots to free up space.
 
**Actions To Do Soon**
If warning threshold is breached, plan to take the following immediate actions:

1. Increase the snapshot reserve space within the volume to accommodate the growth.
2. Configure snapshots to use data space in the volume when the snapshot reserve is full.
|SnapMirror Relationship Lag|Warning @ > 150%…Critical @ >  300%|SnapMirror relationship lag is the difference between the snapshot timestamp and the time on the destination system. The lag_time_percent is the ratio of lag time to the SnapMirror Policy's schedule interval. If the lag time equals the schedule interval, the lag_time_percent will be 100%. If the SnapMirror policy does not have a schedule, lag_time_percent will not be calculated.|Monitor SnapMirror status using the "snapmirror show" command. Check the SnapMirror transfer history using the "snapmirror show-history" command

|Monitor Name|CI Severity|Monitor Description|Corrective Action
|CVO Disk Out of Service|INFO|This event occurs when a disk is removed from service because it has been marked failed, is being sanitized, or has entered the Maintenance Center.|None
|CVO Giveback of Storage Pool Failed|CRITICAL|This event occurs during the migration of an aggregate as part of a storage failover (SFO) giveback, when the destination node cannot reach the object stores.|Perform the following corrective actions:

Verify that your intercluster LIF is online and functional by using the "network interface show" command.

Check network connectivity to the object store server by using the"'ping" command over the destination node intercluster LIF.

Verify that the configuration of your object store has not changed and that login and connectivity information is still accurate by using the "aggregate object-store config show" command.

Alternatively, you can override the error by specifying false for the "require-partner-waiting" parameter of the giveback command.

Contact NetApp technical support for more information or assistance.
|CVO HA Interconnect Down|WARNING|The high-availability (HA) interconnect is down. Risk of service outage when failover is not available.|Corrective actions depend on the number and type of HA interconnect links supported by the platform, as well as the reason why the interconnect is down. 

If the links are down:

Verify that both controllers in the HA pair are operational.

For externally connected links, make sure that the interconnect cables are connected properly and that the small form-factor pluggables (SFPs), if applicable, are seated properly on both controllers.

For internally connected links, disable and re-enable the links, one after the other, by using the "ic link off" and "ic link on" commands. 

If links are disabled, enable the links by using the "ic link on" command. 

If a peer is not connected, disable and re-enable the links, one after the other, by using the "ic link off" and "ic link on" commands.

Contact NetApp technical support if the issue persists.
|CVO Max Sessions Per User Exceeded|WARNING

|You have exceeded the maximum number of sessions allowed per user over a TCP connection. Any request to establish a session will be denied until some sessions are released. 

|Perform the following corrective actions: 

Inspect all the applications that run on the client, and terminate any that are not operating properly.

Reboot the client.

Check if the issue is caused by a new or existing application:

If the application is new, set a higher threshold for the client by using the "cifs option modify -max-opens-same-file-per-tree" command.
In some cases, clients operate as expected, but require a higher threshold. You should have advanced privilege to set a higher threshold for the client. 

If the issue is caused by an existing application, there might be an issue with the client. Contact NetApp technical support for more information or assistance.
|CVO NetBIOS Name Conflict|CRITICAL

|The NetBIOS Name Service has received a negative response to a name registration request, from a remote machine. This is typically caused by a conflict in the NetBIOS name or an alias. As a result, clients might not be able to access data or connect to the right data-serving node in the cluster.|Perform any one of the following corrective actions:

If there is a conflict in the NetBIOS name or an alias, perform one of the following:

Delete the duplicate NetBIOS alias by using the "vserver cifs delete -aliases alias -vserver vserver" command.

Rename a NetBIOS alias by deleting the duplicate name and adding an alias with a new name by using the "vserver cifs create -aliases alias -vserver vserver" command. 

If there are no aliases configured and there is a conflict in the NetBIOS name, then rename the CIFS server by using the "vserver cifs delete -vserver vserver" and "vserver cifs create -cifs-server netbiosname" commands.
NOTE: Deleting a CIFS server can make data inaccessible. 

Remove NetBIOS name or rename the NetBIOS on the remote machine.
|CVO NFSv4 Store Pool Exhausted|CRITICAL|A NFSv4 store pool has been exhausted.|If the NFS server is unresponsive for more than 10 minutes after this event, contact NetApp technical support.
|CVO Node Panic|WARNING|This event is issued when a panic occurs|Contact NetApp customer support.
|CVO Node Root Volume Space Low|CRITICAL|The system has detected that the root volume is dangerously low on space. The node is not fully operational. Data LIFs might have failed over within the cluster, because of which NFS and CIFS access is limited on the node. Administrative capability is limited to local recovery procedures for the node to clear up space on the root volume.|Perform the following corrective actions:

Clear up space on the root volume by deleting old Snapshot copies, deleting files you no longer need from the /mroot directory, or expanding the root volume capacity.

Reboot the controller.

Contact NetApp technical support for more information or assistance.
|CVO Nonexistent Admin Share|CRITICAL|Vscan issue: a client has attempted to connect to a nonexistent ONTAP_ADMIN$ share. |Ensure that Vscan is enabled for the mentioned SVM ID. Enabling Vscan on a SVM causes the ONTAP_ADMIN$ share to be created for the SVM automatically.
|CVO Object Store Host Unresolvable|CRITICAL|The object store server host name cannot be resolved to an IP address. The object store client cannot communicate with the object-store server without resolving to an IP address. As a result, data might be inaccessible. |Check the DNS configuration to verify that the host name is configured correctly with an IP address.
|CVO Object Store Intercluster LIF Down|CRITICAL|The object-store client cannot find an operational LIF to communicate with the object store server. The node will not allow object store client traffic until the intercluster LIF is operational. As a result, data might be inaccessible. |Perform the following corrective actions:

Check the intercluster LIF status by using the "network interface show -role intercluster" command.

Verify that the intercluster LIF is configured correctly and operational.

If an intercluster LIF is not configured, add it by using the "network interface create -role intercluster" command.
|CVO Object Store Signature Mismatch|CRITICAL|The request signature sent to the object store server does not match the signature calculated by the client. As a result, data might be inaccessible. |Verify that the secret access key is configured correctly. If it is configured correctly, contact NetApp technical support for assistance.
|CVO QoS Monitor Memory Maxed Out|CRITICAL|The QoS subsystem's dynamic memory has reached its limit for the current platform hardware. Some QoS features might operate in a limited capacity.|Delete some active workloads or streams to free up memory. Use the “statistics show -object workload -counter ops” command to determine which workloads are active. Active workloads show non-zero ops. Then use the “workload delete <workload_name>” command multiple times to remove specific workloads. Alternatively, use the “stream delete -workload <workload name> *” command to delete the associated streams from the active workload.
|CVO READDIR Timeout|CRITICAL|A READDIR file operation has exceeded the timeout that it is allowed to run in WAFL. This can be because of very large or sparse directories. Corrective action is recommended. |Perform the following corrective actions:

Find information specific to recent directories that have had READDIR file operations expire by using the following 'diag' privilege nodeshell CLI command:
wafl readdir notice show.

Check if directories are indicated as sparse or not:

If a directory is indicated as sparse, it is recommended that you copy the contents of the directory to a new directory to remove the sparseness of the directory file. 

If a directory is not indicated as sparse and the directory is large, it is recommended that you reduce the size of the directory file by reducing the number of file entries in the directory.
|CVO Relocation of Storage Pool Failed|CRITICAL|This event occurs during the relocation of an aggregate, when the destination node cannot reach the object stores. |Perform the following corrective actions:

Verify that your intercluster LIF is online and functional by using the "network interface show" command.

Check network connectivity to the object store server by using the"'ping" command over the destination node intercluster LIF. 

Verify that the configuration of your object store has not changed and that login and connectivity information is still accurate by using the "aggregate object-store config show" command.

Alternatively, you can override the error by using the "override-destination-checks" parameter of the relocation command.

Contact NetApp technical support for more information or assistance.
|CVO Shadow Copy Failed|CRITICAL|A Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS), a Microsoft Server backup and restore service operation, has failed.|Check the following using the information provided in the event message:

Is shadow copy configuration enabled?

Are the appropriate licenses installed? 

On which shares is the shadow copy operation performed?

Is the share name correct?

Does the share path exist?

What are the states of the shadow copy set and its shadow copies?
|CVO Storage VM Stop Succeeded|INFO|This message occurs when a 'vserver stop' operation succeeds.|Use 'vserver start' command to start the data access on a storage VM.
|CVO Too Many CIFS Authentication|WARNING|Many authentication negotiations have occurred simultaneously. There are 256 incomplete new session requests from this client.|Investigate why the client has created 256 or more new connection requests. You might have to contact the vendor of the client or of the application to determine why the error occurred.
|CVO Unassigned Disks|INFO|System has unassigned disks - capacity is being wasted and your system may have some misconfiguration or partial configuration change applied.|Perform the following corrective actions:

Determine which disks are unassigned by using the "disk show -n" command.

Assign the disks to a system by using the "disk assign" command.
|CVO Unauthorized User Access to Admin Share|WARNING|A client has attempted to connect to the privileged ONTAP_ADMIN$ share even though their logged-in user is not an allowed user.|Perform the following corrective actions:

Ensure that the mentioned username and IP address is configured in one of the active Vscan scanner pools.

Check the scanner pool configuration that is currently active by using the "vserver vscan scanner pool show-active" command.
|CVO Virus Detected|WARNING|A Vscan server has reported an error to the storage system. This typically indicates that a virus has been found. However, other errors on the Vscan server can cause this event.

Client access to the file is denied. The Vscan server might, depending on its settings and configuration, clean the file, quarantine it, or delete it.|Check the log of the Vscan server reported in the "syslog" event to see if it was able to successfully clean, quarantine, or delete the infected file. If it was not able to do so, a system administrator might have to manually delete the file.
|CVO Volume Offline|INFO|This message indicates that a volume is made offline.|Bring the volume back online.
|CVO Volume Restricted|INFO|This event indicates that a flexible volume is made restricted.|Bring the volume back online.
