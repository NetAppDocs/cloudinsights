Cloud Insights includes a number of system-defined monitors for both metrics and logs. The Monitors interface will include a number of changes to accomodate these system monitors. These are described in this section.

NOTE: System Monitors are in _Paused_ state by default. Before resuming the monitor, you must ensure that _Advanced Counter Data Collection_ and _Enable ONTAP EMS log collection_ are enabled in the Data Collector. These options can be found in the ONTAP Data Collector under _Advanced Configuration_:

//NOTE: Since System-Defined monitors are a Preview feature, they are subject to change.

////
== Create the Monitor 

. From the Cloud Insights menu, click *Alerts > Manage Monitors*
+
The Monitors list page is displayed, showing currently configured monitors. 

. To modify an existing monitor, click the monitor name in the list.

. To add a monitor, Click *+ Monitor*. 
+
image:Monitor_log_or_metric.png[Choose system or log monitor]
+
When you add a new monitor, you are prompted to create a Metric Monitor or a Log Monitor.

* _Metric_ monitors alert on infrastructure- or performance-related triggers
* _Log_ monitors alert on log-related activity

+
After you choose your monitor type, the Monitor Configuration dialog is displayed.


==== Metric Monitor

. In the drop-down, search for and choose an object type and metric to monitor.

You can set filters to narrow down which object attributes or metrics to monitor. 

//image:select_metric_to_monitor.png[Select Metric]

image:MonitorMetricFilter.png[Metrics Filtering]

//When working with integration data (Kubernetes, ONTAP Advanced Data, etc.), metric filtering works against the data samples themselves, not the objects as with infrastructure data (storage, VMs, ports, etc.).

When working with integration data (Kubernetes, ONTAP Advanced Data, etc.), metric filtering removes the individual/unmatched data points from the plotted data series, unlike infrastructure data (storage, VM, ports etc.) where filters work on the aggregated value of the data series and potentially remove the entire object from the chart.

//image:IntegrationMetricFilterExample.png[Integration Metric Filtering]

TIP: To create a multi-condition monitor (e.g., IOPS > X and latency > Y), define the first condition as a threshold and the second condition as a filter.


===== Define the Conditions of the Monitor. 

. After choosing the object and metric to monitor, set the Warning-level and/or Critical-level thresholds.
. For the _Warning_ level, enter 200 for our example. The dashed line indicating this Warning level displays in the example graph.
. For the _Critical_ level, enter 400. The dashed line indicating this Critical level displays in the example graph.
+
The graph displays historical data. The Warning and Critical level lines on the graph are a visual representation of the Monitor, so you can easily see when the Monitor might trigger an alert in each case. 

. For the occurence interval, choose _Continuously_ for a period of _15 Minutes_.
+
You can choose to trigger an alert the moment a threshold is breached, or wait until the threshold has been in continuous breach for a period of time. In our example, we do not want to be alerted every time the Total IOPS peaks above the Warning or Critical level, but only when a monitored object continuously exceeds one of these levels for at least 15 minutes.
+
//image:define_monitor_conditions.png[Define Conditions]
image:Monitor_metric_conditions.png[Define the monitor's conditions]






=== Log Monitor

When creating a *Log monitor*, first choose which log to monitor from the available log list. You can then filter based on the available attributes as above.

For example, you might choose to filter for "object.store.unavailable" message type in the logs.netapp.ems source:

NOTE: The Log Monitor filter cannot be empty. 

image:Monitor_log_monitor_filter.png[choose which log to monitor, and set a filter]



==== Define the alert behavior

Choose how you want to alert when a log alert is triggered. You can set the monitor to alert with _Warning_, _Critical_, or _Informational_ severity, based on the filter conditions you set above.

image:Monitor_log_alert_behavior.png[define the log behavior to monitor]


==== Define the alert resolution behavior

You can choose how an log monitor alert is resolved. You are presented with three choices:

* *Resolve instantly*: The alert is immediately resolved with no further action needed
* *Resolve based on time*: The alert is resolved after the specified time has passed
* *Resolve based on log entry*: The alert is resolved when a subsequent log activity has occurred. For example, when an object is logged as "available".

image:Monitor_log_monitor_resolution.png[Alert Resolution]



==== Select notification type and recipients

In the _Set up team notification(s)_ section, you can choose whether to alert your team via email or Webhook.

image:Webhook_Choose_Monitor_Notification.png[Choose alerting method]

*Alerting via Email:*

Specify the email recipients for alert notifications. If desired, you can choose different recipients for warning or critical alerts.

image:email_monitor_alerts.png[Email Alert Recipients]

*Alerting via Webhook:*

Specify the webhook(s) for alert notifications. If desired, you can choose different webhooks for warning or critical alerts.

image:Webhook_Monitor_Notifications.png[Webhook Alerting]


==== Setting Corrective Actions or Additional Information

You can add an optional description as well as additional insights and/or corrective actions by filling in the *Add an Alert Description* section. The description can be up to 1024 characters and will be sent with the alert. The insights/corrective action field can be up to 67,000 characters and will be displayed in the summary section of the alert landing page.

In these fields you can provide notes, links, or steps to take to correct or otherwise address the alert.

image:Monitors_Alert_Description.png[Alert Corrective Actions and Description]


==== Save your Monitor

. If desired, you can add a description of the monitor. 
+
. Give the Monitor a meaningful name and click *Save*.
+
Your new monitor is added to the list of active Monitors.

==== Monitor List

The Monitor page lists the currently configured monitors, showing the following:

* Monitor Name
* Status 
* Object/metric being monitored
* Conditions of the Monitor

You can choose to temporarily pause monitoring of an object type by clicking the menu to the right of the monitor and selecting *Pause*. When you are ready to resume monitoring, click *Resume*.

You can copy a monitor by selecting *Duplicate* from the menu. You can then modify the new monitor and change the object/metric, filter, conditions, email recipients, etc.

If a monitor is no longer needed, you can delete it by selecting *Delete* from the menu.





////
== Monitor Groups

Grouping allows you to view and manage related monitors. For example, you can have a monitor group dedicated to the storage in your environment, or monitors relevant to a certain recipient list. 

image:Monitors_GroupList.png[Monitor Grouping]

////
Two groups are shown by default:

* *All Monitors* lists all monitors.
* *Custom Monitors* lists only user-created monitors.
////

The number of monitors contained in a group is shown next to the group name.


NOTE: Custom monitors can be paused, resumed, deleted, or moved to another group. System-defined monitors can be paused and resumed but can not be deleted or moved.


=== Custom Monitor Groups

To create a new custom monitor group, click the *"+" Create New Monitor Group* button. Enter a name for the group and click *Create Group*. An empty group is created with that name. 


To add monitors to the group, go to the _All Monitors_ group (recommended) and do one of the following:

* To add a single monitor, click the menu to the right of the monitor and select _Add to Group_. Choose the group to which to add the monitor.
* Click on the monitor name to open the monitor's edit view, and select a group in the _Associate to a monitor group_ section.
+
image:Monitors_AssociateToGroup.png[Associate to group]

//* To add multiple monitors to a group, select them by clicking the checkbox next to each monitor, then click the *Bulk Actions* button and select _Move to Group_.

Remove monitors by clicking on a group and selecting _Remove from Group_ from the menu. You can not remove monitors from the _All Monitors_ or _Custom Monitors_ group. To delete a monitor from these groups, you must delete the monitor itself.

//To remove a monitor from a group while editing the monitor, in the _Associate with a group_ section, click the *X* next to the group name.

NOTE: Removing a monitor from a group does not delete the monitor from Cloud Insights. To completely remove a monitor, select the monitor and click _Delete_. This also removes it from the group to which it belonged and it is no longer available to any user.

You can also move a monitor to a different group in the same manner, selecting _Move to Group_. 

//NOTE: Each monitor can belong to only a single group at any given time (in addition to belonging to "All Monitors" and "Custom Monitors"). 

To pause or resume all monitors in a group at once, select the menu for the group and click _Pause_ or _Resume_. 

Use the same menu to rename or delete a group. Deleting a group does not delete the monitors from Cloud Insights; they are still available in _All Monitors_.

== Monitor Descriptions

System-defined monitors are comprised of pre-defined metrics and conditions, as well as default descriptions and corrective actions, which can not be modified. You _can_ modify the notification recipient list for system-defined monitors. To view the metrics, conditions, description and corrective actions, or to modify the recipient list, open a system-defined monitor group and click the monitor name in the list.

System-defined monitor groups cannot be modified or removed.

The following system-defined monitors are available, in the noted groups.

* *ONTAP Infrastructure* includes monitors for infrastructure-related issues in ONTAP clusters. 
* *ONTAP Workload Examples* includes monitors for workload-related issues. 
* Monitors in both group default to _Paused_ state.

Below are the system monitors currently included with Cloud Insights:

=== Metric Monitors

|===
|Monitor Name|Severity|Description|Corrective Action
|Fiber Channel Port High Utilization|CRITICAL|Fiber Channel Protocol ports are used to receive and transfer the SAN traffic between the customer host system and the ONTAP LUNs. If the port utilization is high, then it will become a bottleneck and it will ultimately affect the performance of sensitive of Fiber Channel Protocol workloads. A warning alert indicates that planned action should be taken to balance network traffic. A critical alert indicates that service disruption is imminent and emergency measures should be taken to balance network traffic to ensure service continuity.|Immediate actions are required to minimize service disruption if critical threshold is breached:

|QTree Capacity Hard Limit|CRITICAL|A qtree is a logically defined file system that can exist as a special subdirectory of the root directory within a volume. Each qtree has a space quota measured in KBytes that it can use to store data in order to control the growth of user data in volume and not exceed its total capacity. A qtree maintains a soft storage capacity quota in order to be able to alert the user proactively before reaching the total capacity quota limit in the qtree and being unable to store data anymore. Monitoring the amount of data stored within a qtree ensures that the user receives uninterrupted data service.|Immediate actions are required to minimize service disruption if critical threshold is breached:
1. Consider increasing the tree space quota in order to accommodate the growth
2. Consider instructing the user to delete unwanted data in the tree that is not needed anymore in order to free up space
|QTree Capacity is Full|CRITICAL|A qtree is a logically defined file system that can exist as a special subdirectory of the root directory within a volume. Each qtree has a default space quota or a quota defined by a quota policy to limit amount of data stored in the tree within the volume capacity. A warning alert indicates that planned action should be taken to increase the space.

1. Consider increasing the file count quota for the qtree
2. Delete files that are not used any more from the qtree file system
|Snapshot Reserve Space is Full|CRITICAL|Storage capacity of a volume is necessary to store application and customer data. A portion of that space, called snapshot reserved space, is used to store snapshots which allow data to be protected locally. The more new and updated data stored in the ONTAP volume the more snapshot capacity is used and less snapshot storage capacity will be available for future new or updated data. If the snapshot data capacity within a volume reaches the total snapshot reserve space it may lead to the customer being unable to store new snapshot data and reduction in the level of protection for the data in the volume. Monitoring the volume used snapshot capacity ensures data services continuity.|Immediate actions are required to minimize service disruption if critical threshold is breached:
1. Consider configuring snapshots to use data space in the volume when the snapshot reserve is full
2. Consider deleting some older snapshots that may not be needed anymore to free up space…
Plan to take the following actions soon if warning threshold is breached:
1. Consider increasing the snapshot reserve space within the volume to accommodate the growth
2. Consider configuring snapshots to use data space in the volume when the snapshot reserve is full
|Storage Capacity Limit|CRITICAL|When a storage pool (aggregate) fills up, I/O operations slow down and finally cease causing a storage outage incident. A warning alert indicates that planned action should be taken soon to restore minimum free space. A critical alert indicates that service disruption is imminent and emergency measures should be taken to free up space to ensure service continuity.|Immediate actions are required to minimize service disruption if critical threshold is breached:
1. Delete Snapshots on non-critical volumes
2. Delete Volumes or LUNs that are non-essential workloads and that may be restored from off storage copies…
Plan to take the following actions soon if warning threshold is breached:
1. Move one or more volumes to a different storage location
2. Add more storage capacity
3. Change storage efficiency settings or tier inactive data to cloud storage
|Storage Performance Limit|CRITICAL|When a storage system reaches its performance limit, operations slow down, latency goes up and workloads and applications may start failing. ONTAP evaluates the storage pool utilization due to workloads and estimates what percent of performance has been consumed. A warning alert indicates that planned action should be taken to reduce storage pool load to as there may not be enough storage pool performance left to service workload peaks. A critical alert indicates that a performance brownout is imminent and emergency measures should be taken to reduce storage pool load to ensure service continuity.|Immediate actions are required to minimize service disruption if critical threshold is breached:
1. Suspend scheduled tasks such as Snapshots or SnapMirror replication
2. Idle non-essential workloads…
Plan to take the following actions soon if warning threshold is breached:
1. Move one or more workloads to a different storage location
2. Add more storage nodes (AFF) or disk shelves (FAS)and redistribute workloads
3. Change workload characteristics(block size, application caching etc)
|User Quota Capacity Hard Limit|CRITICAL|ONTAP recognize the users of Unix or Windows systems that have the rights to access volumes, files or directories within a volume. As a result ONTAP allows the customers to configure storage capacity for their users or groups of users of their Linux or Windows systems. The user or group policy quota limits the amount of space the user can utilize for their own data. A hard limit of this quota allows notification of the user when the amount of capacity used within the volume is right before reaching the total capacity quota. Monitoring the amount of data stored within a user or group quota ensures that the user receives uninterrupted data service.|Immediate actions are required to minimize service disruption if critical threshold is breached:
1. Consider increasing the space of the user or group quota in order to accommodate the growth
2. Consider instructing the user or group to delete data that is not needed anymore to free up space.
|User Quota Capacity Soft Limit|WARNING|ONTAP recognize the users of Unix or Windows systems that have the rights to access volumes, files or directories within a volume. As a result ONTAP allows the customers to configure storage capacity for their users or groups of users of their Linux or Windows systems. The user or group policy quota limits the amount of space the user can utilize for their own data. A soft limit of this quota allows proactive notification of the user when the amount of capacity used within the volume is reaching the total capacity quota. Monitoring the amount of data stored within a user or group quota ensures that the user receives uninterrupted data service.|Plan to take the following actions soon if warning threshold is breached:
1. Consider increasing the space of the user or group quota in order to accommodate the growth
2. Consider deleting data that is not needed anymore to free up space.
|Volume Capacity is Full|CRITICAL|Storage capacity of a volume is necessary to store application and customer data. The more data stored in the ONTAP volume the less storage availability for future data. If the data storage capacity within a volume reaches the total storage capacity may lead to the customer being unable to store data due to lack of storage capacity. Monitoring the volume used storage capacity ensures data services continuity.|Immediate actions are required to minimize service disruption if critical threshold is breached:

2. If the volume has a QoS policy assigned to it, evaluate its limit thresholds in case they are causing the volume workload to get throttled.
3. If the node is also experiencing high utilization, move the volume to another node or reduce the total workload of the node
|Volume Inodes Limit|CRITICAL|Volumes that store files use index nodes (inode) to store file metadata. When a volume exhausts its inode allocation no more files can be added to it. A warning alert indicates that planned action should be taken to increase the number of available inodes. A critical alert indicates that file limit exhaustion is imminent and emergency measures should be taken to free up inodes to ensure service continuity.|Immediate actions are required to minimize service disruption if critical threshold is breached:
1. Consider increasing the inodes value for the volume. If the inodes value is already at the max, then consider splitting the volume into two or more volumes because the file system has grown beyond the maximum size
2. Consider using FlexGroup as it helps to accommodate large file systems…
