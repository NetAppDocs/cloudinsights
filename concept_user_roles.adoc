= User accounts

[.lead]

Cloud Insights provides four user account roles: Account Owner, Administrator, User, and Guest. Each account is assigned specific permission levels. Users are either link:#creating-accounts-by-inviting-users[invited] to Cloud Insights and assigned a specific role, or can sign in via link:#single-sign-on-sso-accounts[Single Sign-On (SSO)] with a default role. SSO is available as a feature in Cloud Insights Premium Edition.

== Permission levels

You use an account that has Administrator privileges to create or modify user accounts. Each user account is assigned a role for each Cloud Insights feature from the following permission levels.

////
* *Guest* can view asset pages, dashboards, and queries, and run queries.
* *User* can perform all guest-level privileges as well as create, modify, or delete dashboards, queries, annotations, annotation rules, and applications.
* *Administrator* and *Account Owner* can perform all functions, as well as create, modify and delete policies, import dashboards, and manage all users and data collectors.
////



|===
|Role	|Monitoring	|Cloud Secure	|Reporting

|Account Owner	
3+>|Can modify subscriptions, view billing and usage information, and perform all Administrator functions for Monitoring & Optimization, Cloud Secure, and Reporting.
Owners can also invite and manage users.

The Account Owner is created when you register for Cloud Insights.

|Administrator	
|Can perform all Monitoring & Optimization functions, all user functions, as well as management of data collectors, API keys, and notifications.
An Administrator can also invite other users but can only assign Monitor and Optimize roles. 

|Can perform all Cloud Secure functions, including those for Alerts, Forensics, data collectors, automated response policies, and APIs for Cloud Secure.
An Administrator can also invite other users but can only assign Cloud Secure roles.

|Can perform all User/Author functions, as well as all administrative tasks such as configuration of reports, and the shutdown and restart of reporting tasks.
An Administrator can also invite other users but can only assign Reporting roles.

|User	
|Can view and modify dashboards, queries, alerts, annotations, annotation rules, and applications, and manage device resolution.
|n/a	
|Can perform all Guest/Consumer functions as well as create and manage reports and dashboards.

|Guest	
|Has read-only access to asset pages, dashboards, alerts, and can view and run queries.
|n/a	
|Can view, schedule, and run reports and set personal preferences such as those for languages and time zones. Guests/Consumers cannot create reports or perform administrative tasks.

|===





Best practice is to limit the number of users with Administrator permissions. The greatest number of accounts should be user or guest accounts.

== Creating Accounts by Inviting Users

Creating a new user account is achieved through Cloud Central. A user can respond to the invitation sent through email, but if the user does not have an account with Cloud Central, the user needs to sign up with Cloud Central so that they can accept the invitation.

.Before you begin

* The user name is the email address of the invitation.
* Understand the user roles you will be assigning.
* Passwords are defined by the user during the sign up process. 

.Steps

. Log into Cloud Insights
. In the menu, click *Admin > User Management*
+
The User Management screen is displayed. The screen contains a list of all of the accounts on the system.
. Click *+ User*
+
The *Invite User* screen is displayed.

. Enter an email address or multiple addresses for invitations.
+
*Note:* When you enter multiple addresses, they are all created with the same role. You can only set multiple users to the same role.

//. Enter the user's e-mail address.

. Select the user's role for each feature of Cloud Insights. 
+
NOTE: The features and roles you can choose from depend on which features you have access to in your particular Administrator role. For example, if you have Admin role only for Cloud Secure, you will be able to assign users to any role in Cloud Secure, but only Guest role for Monitor and Optimize. You will not be able to assign roles for Reporting.

. Click *Invite*
+
The invitation is sent to the user. Users will have 14 days to accept the invitation. Once a user accepts the invitation, they will be taken to the NetApp Cloud Portal, where they will sign up using the email address in the invitation.
If they have an existing account for that email address, they can simply sign in and will then be able to access their Cloud Insights environment.

== Single Sign-On (SSO) Accounts

In addition to inviting users, administrators can enable *Single Sign-On* (SSO) access to Cloud Insights for all users in their corporate domain, without having to invite them individually. With SSO enabled, any user with the same domain email address can log into Cloud Insights using their corporate credentials.

NOTE: SSO is available in Cloud Insights Premium Edition, and must be configured before it can be enabled for Cloud Insights. SSO configuration includes link:https://services.cloud.netapp.com/misc/federation-support[Identity Federation] through NetApp Cloud Central. Federation allows single sign-on users to access your NetApp Cloud Central accounts using credentials from your corporate directory, using open standards such as Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML) and OpenID Connect (OIDC). 

To configure SSO, on the *Admin > User Management* page, click the *Configure SSO* button. Once configured, administrators can then enable SSO user login. When an administrator enables SSO, they choose a default role for all SSO users (such as Guest or User). Users who log in through SSO will have that default role.

Occasionally, an administrator will want to promote a single user out of the default SSO role (for example, to make them an administrator). They can accomplish this on the *Admin > User Management* page by clicking on the right-side menu for the user and selecting _Assign Role_. Users who are assigned an explicit role in this way continue to have access to Cloud Insights even if SSO is subsequently disabled. 

If the user no longer requires the elevated role, you can click the menu to _Remove User_. The user will be removed from the list. If SSO is enabled, the user can continue log in to Cloud Insights through SSO, with the default role.

You can choose to hide SSO users by unchecking the *Show SSO Users* checkbox.
