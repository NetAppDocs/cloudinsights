Cloud Insights provides four user accounts, Account Owner, Administrator, User, and Guest. Each account is assigned specific permission levels.

The following illustration identifies the permissions granted to each user account.

You use an account that has Administrator privileges to create or modify user accounts. Each user account is assigned one of the following permission levels.
* Guest can view asset pages, dashboards, queries and run queries.
* User can perform all guest-level privileges, and create, modify or delete, dashboards, queries, annotations, annotation rules, and applications.  Users cannot create modify or delete policies.
* Admins and Account Owner can perform all functions including adding new users and managing data collectors.

The Account Owner is created when you register for Cloud Insights.

Best practice is to limit the number of users with Administrator permissions <or Privs...get the wording straight> . The greatest number of accounts should be user or guest accounts.
