[.lead]
Cloud Insights provides up to four user account roles: Account Owner, Administrator, User, and Guest. Each account is assigned specific permission levels as noted in the table below.  Users are either link:#creating-accounts-by-inviting-users[invited] to Cloud Insights and assigned a specific role, or can sign in via link:#single-sign-on-sso-accounts[Single Sign-On (SSO) Authorization] with a default role. SSO Authorization is available as a feature in Cloud Insights Premium Edition.

NOTE: User logins in Cloud Insights Federal Edition are limited to configured identity providers (with their specified email domains). When a new user is invited to a Cloud Insights Federal environment, their email address must match the domain configured for that environment.

== Permission levels

You use an account that has Administrator privileges to create or modify user accounts. Each user account is assigned a role for each Cloud Insights feature from the following permission levels.

////
* *Guest* can view asset pages, dashboards, and queries, and run queries.
* *User* can perform all guest-level privileges as well as create, modify, or delete dashboards, queries, annotations, annotation rules, and applications.
* *Administrator* and *Account Owner* can perform all functions, as well as create, modify and delete policies, import dashboards, and manage all users and data collectors.

|===
|Role	|Observability |Workload Security |Reporting 

|Account Owner	
3+<|Can modify subscriptions, view billing and usage information, and perform all Administrator functions for Observability, Security, and Reporting.
Owners can also invite and manage users, as well as manage SSO Authentication and Identity Federation settings. 

The first Account Owner is created when you register for Cloud Insights.

It is strongly recommended to have at least two Account Owners for each Cloud Insights environment. 

|Administrator	
|Can perform all Observability functions, all user functions, as well as management of data collectors, Observability API tokens, and notifications.
An Administrator can also invite other users but can only assign Observability roles. 

|Can perform all Security functions, including those for Alerts, Forensics, data collectors, automated response policies, and API tokens for Security.
An Administrator can also invite other users but can only assign Security roles.

|Can perform all User/Author functions including managing Reporting API tokens, as well as all administrative tasks such as configuration of reports, and the shutdown and restart of reporting tasks.
An Administrator can also invite other users but can only assign Reporting roles.

|User	
|Can view and modify dashboards, queries, alerts, annotations, annotation rules, and applications, and manage device resolution.
|Can view and manage Alerts and view Forensics. User role can change alert status, add a note, take snapshots manually, and manage restrict user access.
|Can perform all Guest/Consumer functions as well as create and manage reports and dashboards.

|Guest	
|Has read-only access to asset pages, dashboards, alerts, and can view and run queries.
|Can view Alerts and Forensics. Guest role cannot change alert status, add a note, take snapshots manually, or restrict user access.
|Can view, schedule, and run reports and set personal preferences such as those for languages and time zones. Guests/Consumers cannot create reports or perform administrative tasks.

== Creating Accounts by Inviting Users

Creating a new user account is achieved through Cloud Central. A user can respond to the invitation sent through email, but if the user does not have an account with Cloud Central, the user needs to sign up with Cloud Central so that they can accept the invitation.

.Before you begin

* The user name is the email address of the invitation.
* Understand the user roles you will be assigning.
* Passwords are defined by the user during the sign up process. 

.Steps

. Log into Cloud Insights
. In the menu, click *Admin > User Management*
+
The User Management screen is displayed. The screen contains a list of all of the accounts on the system.
. Click *+ User*
+
The *Invite User* screen is displayed.

. Enter an email address or multiple addresses for invitations.
+
*Note:* When you enter multiple addresses, they are all created with the same role. You can only set multiple users to the same role.

//. Enter the user's e-mail address.

. Select the user's role for each feature of Cloud Insights. 
+
NOTE: The features and roles you can choose from depend on which features you have access to in your particular Administrator role. For example, if you have Admin role only for Reporting, you will be able to assign users to any role in Reporting, but will not be able to assign roles for Observability or Security.
+
image:UserRoleChoices.png[User Role Choices]


. Click *Invite*
+
The invitation is sent to the user. Users will have 14 days to accept the invitation. Once a user accepts the invitation, they will be taken to the NetApp Cloud Portal, where they will sign up using the email address in the invitation. If they have an existing account for that email address, they can simply sign in and will then be able to access their Cloud Insights environment.


== Modifying an existing user's role

To modify an existing user's role, including adding them as a *secondary account owner*, follow these steps.

. Click *Admin > User Management*. The screen displays a list of all of the accounts on the system.
. Click the user name of the account you want to change.
. Modify the user's role in each Cloud Insights feature set as needed.
. Click _Save Changes_.

=== To assign a Secondary Account Owner

You must be logged in as an account owner for Observability in order to assign the account owner role to another user.

. Click *Admin > User Management*. 
. Click the user name of the account you want to change.
. In the User dialog, click on *Assign as Owner*.
. Save the changes.

image:Assign_Account_Owner.png[user change dialog showing account owner choice]

You can have as many account owners as you wish, but best practice is to limit the owner role to only select people.


== Deleting Users

A user with the Administrator role can delete a user (for example, someone no longer with the company) by clicking on the user's name and clicking _Delete User_ in the dialog. The user will be removed from the Cloud Insights environment. 

Note that any dashboards, queries, etc. that were created by the user will remain available in the Cloud Insights environment even after the user is removed. 

== Single Sign-On (SSO) and Identity Federation

=== Enabling Identity Federation for SSO In Cloud Insights  

With Identity Federation:

* Authentication is delegated to the customer’s identity management system, using the customer’s credentials from your corporate directory, and automatization policies such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).   
* Users log in once to all NetApp Cloud Services (Single Sign On). 

User accounts are managed in NetApp Cloud Central for all Cloud Services. By default, authentication is done using Cloud Central local user profile. Below is a simplified overview of that process: 

image:CloudCentralAuthentication.png[Cloud Central Authentication]

However, some customers would like to use their own identity provider to authenticate their users for Cloud Insights and their other NetApp Cloud Central Services. With Identity Federation, NetApp Cloud Central accounts are authenticated using credentials from your corporate directory.  

The following is a simplified example of that process: 

image:IdentityFederationDiagram-2.png[Identity Federation Illustrated]

In the above diagram, when a user accesses Cloud Insights, that user is directed to the customer’s identity management system for authentication. Once the account is authenticated, the user is directed to the Cloud Insights tenant URL.  

Cloud Central uses Auth0 to implement Identity Federation and integrate with services like Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS) and Microsoft Azure Active Directory (AD). For more information on Identity Federation setup and configuration, see Cloud Central documentation on link:https://services.cloud.netapp.com/misc/federation-support[Identity Federation].

It is important to understand that changing identity federation in Cloud Central will apply not only to Cloud Insights but to all NetApp Cloud Services. The customer should discuss this change with the NetApp team of each Cloud Central product they own to make sure the configuration they are using will work with Identity Federation or if adjustments need to be made on any accounts. The customer will need to involve their internal SSO team in the change to identity federation as well. 

It is also important to realize that once identity federation is enabled, that any changes to the company’s identity provider (such moving from SAML to Microsoft AD) will likely require troubleshooting/changes/attention in Cloud Central to update the profiles of the users. 



=== Single Sign-On (SSO) User Auto-Provisioning 

In addition to inviting users, administrators can enable *Single Sign-On (SSO) User Auto-Provisioning* access to Cloud Insights for all users in their corporate domain, without having to invite them individually. With SSO enabled, any user with the same domain email address can log into Cloud Insights using their corporate credentials.

NOTE: _SSO User Auto-Provisioning_ is available in Cloud Insights Premium Edition, and must be configured before it can be enabled for Cloud Insights. SSO User Auto-Provisining configuration includes link:https://services.cloud.netapp.com/misc/federation-support[Identity Federation] through NetApp Cloud Central as described in the section above. Federation allows single sign-on users to access your NetApp Cloud Central accounts using credentials from your corporate directory, using open standards such as Security Assertion Markup Language 2.0 (SAML) and OpenID Connect (OIDC). 

To configure _SSO User Auto-Provisioning_, on the *Admin > User Management* page, click the *Request Federation* button. Once configured, administrators can then enable SSO user login. When an administrator enables _SSO User Auto-Provisioning_, they choose a default role for all SSO users (such as Guest or User). Users who log in through SSO will have that default role.

//image:SSOBanner.jpg[User Management with SSO]
image:Roles_federation_Banner.png[User management with Federation]

Occasionally, an administrator will want to promote a single user out of the default SSO role (for example, to make them an administrator). They can accomplish this on the *Admin > User Management* page by clicking on the right-side menu for the user and selecting _Assign Role_. Users who are assigned an explicit role in this way continue to have access to Cloud Insights even if _SSO User Auto-Provisioning_ is subsequently disabled. 

If the user no longer requires the elevated role, you can click the menu to _Remove User_. The user will be removed from the list. If _SSO User Auto-Provisioning_ is enabled, the user can continue log in to Cloud Insights through SSO, with the default role.

You can choose to hide SSO users by unchecking the *Show SSO Users* checkbox. 

//image:UserListWithSSO.png[SSO Enabled] 

However, do not enable _SSO User Auto-Provisioning_ if either of these are true: 

* Your organization has more than one Cloud Insights tenant 
* Your organization does not want any/every user in the federated domain to have some level of automatic access to the Cloud Insights tenant. _At this point in time, we do not have the ability to use groups to control role access with this option_.
