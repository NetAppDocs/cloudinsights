Webhooks allow users to send alert notifications to various applications using a customized webhook channel. This page provides an example for setting up Webhooks for PagerDuty.

NOTE: This page refers to third-party instructions, which could be subject to change. Refer to the link:https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations[PagerDuty documentation] for the most up-to-date information. 

=== PagerDuty Setup:

. In PagerDuty, navigate to *Services > Service Directory* and click on the *+New Service* button​

. Enter in a _Name_ and select _Use our API directly_.  Click on _Add Service_.

. Click on the _Integrations_ tab to see the *Integration Key*. You will need this key when you create the Cloud Insights webhook below. 

//. On the same screen, copy or make note of the *Integration URL* under Alert Events. You will need to enter this into the Cloud Insights webhook configuration.

. Go to *Incidents* or *Services* to view Alerts.

=== Create Cloud Insights Webhook:

. In Cloud Insights, navigate to *Admin > Notifications* and select the *Webhooks* tab. Click *+Webhook* to create a new webhook.

. Give the Webhook a meaningful Name, such as "PagerDuty Trigger". You will use this webhook for critical- and warning-level events.

. In the _Template Type_ drop-down, select *PagerDuty*.

//. Enter the PagerDuty Integration URL from above into the _URL_ field.

. Create a custom parameter secret named _routingKey_ and set the value to the PagerDuty _Integration Key_ value from above.

Repeat these steps to create a "PagerDuty Resolve" webhook for resolved events.

=== Notifications via Webhook

To notify on events via webhook, in Cloud Insights navigate to *Alerts > Monitors* and click *+Monitor* to create a new link:task_create_monitor.html[monitor].

* Select a metric and define the monitor's conditions.

* Under _Set up team notification(s), choose the *Webhook* Delivery Method.

* Choose the "PagerDuty Trigger" webhook for Critical- and Warning-level events.

* Choose the "PagerDuty Resolve" for resolved events.

NOTE: Setting separate notifications for trigger events versus resolved events is a best practice, since PagerDuty handles trigger events differently than resolved events. 

//Additionally, if you would like to create a webhook for Warning-level events as well, create a new webhook and set the Message Body _severity_ to "warning".

//Trigger vs Resolve: Two separate templates.  Resolved alerts are no longer displayed in PagerDuty​
