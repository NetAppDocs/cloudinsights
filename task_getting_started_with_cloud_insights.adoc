After you have signed up for Cloud Insights and log in to your environment for the first time, you will be guided through the following steps in order to begin collecting and managing data. 

== See How It Works

The first thing you see after logging in the first time is a short video explaining how Cloud Insights collects data. 

When you are finished watching the video, click *Continue* to proceed to the next step.

== Select a Data Collector

Data collectors discover information from your data sources, such as storage devices, network switches, and virtual machines. The information gathered is used for analysis, validation, monitoring and troubleshooting. 

Cloud Insights utilizes three types of data collectors:

* Operating Systems
* Services
* Infrastructure

Select your first data collector from the supported vendors and models available. You will be taken to the next step.

== Install an Acquisition Unit

If you selected an _Infrastructure_ data collector, an Acquisition Unit is required to inject data into Cloud Insights. You will need to download and install the Acquisition Unit software on a server or VM to collect data for Cloud Insights. A single Acquisition Unit can be used for multiple data collectors.

* Follow the link:task_configure_acquisition_unit.html[instructions] displayed to install your Acquisition Unit.

You may set up additional acquisition units later if needed. For example, you may want different Acquisition Units collecting information from data centers in different regions. 

== Configure the Data Collector - Infrastructure

For _Infrastructure_ data collectors, you will be asked to fill out the data collector fields presented:

* Give the data collector a unique and meaningful name.
* Enter the user name and password to connect to the device, as appropriate.
* Fill in any other mandatory fields in _Configuration_ and _Advanced Configuration_ sections.
* Click *Test Connection* to test the connection to the device.
* Click *Add Collector* to save the data collector.

You will be able to configure additional data collectors later.

== Configure the Data Collector - Operating Systems and Services

=== Operating System:

For _Operating System_ data collectors, choose a platform (MacOS, Linux, Windows) to install a Cloud Insights Agent.
You must have at least one agent to collect data from Services.
The agent also collects data from the host itself, for use in Cloud Insights. This data is categorized as "Node" data in widgets, etc.

* Choose an link:concept_agent_access_key.html[Agent Access Key]. Data Collectors can be grouped by using different Keys for different groupings (by location or platform, for example).
* Open a terminal or command window on the agent host or VM, and paste the displayed command to install the agent. 
* When installation is complete, click *Finish*.

=== Services:

For _Service_ data collectors, click on a tile to open the instructions page for that service.

* Choose a platform and an Agent Access Key.
* If you don't have an agent installed on that platform, follow the instructions to install the agent.
* Click *Continue* to open the data collector instruction page.
* Follow the instructions to configure the data collector.
* When configuration is complete, click *Finish*.

== Add Dashboards

Depending on the type of initial data collector you selected to configure (storage, switch, etc.), you will be presented with a list of example dashboards from which to choose. Select one or more dashboards from the Dashboard Gallery and click *Add Dashboards*. 

The first dashboard in your selected dashboards list will be set as your environment's link:concept_dashboards_overview.html#setting-a-dashboard-as-your-home-page[home page]. You can change the home page from the *Dashboards > Show All Dashboards* list. 

You can import additional dashboards later, or link:concept_dashboards_overview.html[create your own].

== That's all there is to it

After you complete the initial setup process, your environment will begin to collect data. 

NOTE: Please allow up to 30 minutes for your dashboards to start displaying data. Some data collectors require 2 poll periods (usually 15 minutes each) before any meaningful data can be displayed.

If your initial setup process is interrupted (for example, if you close the browser window), you may need to start the process again from the beginning.

== Adding data collectors

Data collectors discover information from your data sources, such as storage devices, network switches, and virtual machines. The information gathered is used for analysis, validation, monitoring and troubleshooting. You need to link:task_configure_data_collectors.html[configure your data collectors] before Cloud Insights can gather data from them.
