This data collector allows collection of data from Apache servers in your environment.

.Pre-requisites

* You must have Apache set up and properly running on your servers
* You must have sudo or administrator permissions on your agent host/VM
* Typically, the Apache _mod_status_ module is configured to expose a page at the '/server-status?auto' location of the Apache server. The _ExtendedStatus_ option must be enabled in order to collect all available fields. For information about how to configure your server, see the Apache module documentation: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_status.html#enable
