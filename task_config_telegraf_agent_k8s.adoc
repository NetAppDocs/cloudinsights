Cloud Insights uses link:https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/[Telegraf] as its agent for collection of integration data. Telegraf is a plugin-driven server agent that can be used to collect and report metrics, events, and logs. Input plugins are used to collect the desired information into the agent by accessing the system/OS directly, by calling third-party APIs, or by listening to configured streams (i.e. Kafka, statsD, etc). Output plugins are used to send the collected metrics, events, and logs from the agent to Cloud Insights. 

The current Telegraf version for Cloud Insights is *1.22.3*.

NOTE: For accurate audit and data reporting, it is strongly recommended to synchronize the time on the Agent machine using *Network Time Protocol (NTP)* or *Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)*.

NOTE: If you want to verify the installation files before installing the Agent, read about <<verify-ng-kubernetes-checksums, Verifying Kubernetes Checksums>>.

== Before installing the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator on Kubernetes

Cloud Insights offers the *NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator* for Kubernetes collection. When adding a data collector, simply choose the "Kubernetes" tile.


.Pre-requisites:

* NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator installation is supported with Kubernetes version 1.20 or greater. When used with the Docker container runtime, Cloud Insights can display pod-to-PV-to-storage mappings for NFS and iSCSI; other runtimes only show iSCSI. Beginning August 2022, the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator includes support for Pod Security Policy (PSP). You must <<upgrading, upgrade>> to the latest NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator if your environment uses PSP.

* If you are running on OpenShift 4.6 or higher, you must follow the *OpenShift Instructions* below in addition to ensuring these pre-requisites are met.

* Monitoring is only installed on Linux nodes
+
Cloud Insights supports monitoring of Kubernetes nodes that are running Linux, by specifying a Kubernetes node selector that looks for the following Kubernetes labels on these platforms:
+
|===
|Platform|Label
|Kubernetes v1.19 and above |Kubernetes.io/os = linux
|Rancher + cattle.io as orchestration/Kubernetes platform |cattle.io/os = linux
|===

* The NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator and its dependencies (telegraf, kube-state-metrics, fluentbit, etc.) are not supported on nodes that are running with Arm64 architecture.

* The following commands must be available: _curl_, _sudo_, _openssl_, _sha256sum_, and _kubectl_. For best results, add these commands to the PATH.

* The host you will use for the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator installation must have _kubectl_ configured to communicate with the target K8s cluster, and have Internet connectivity to your Cloud Insights environment.

* The NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator installs its own kube-state-metrics to avoid conflict with any other instances. 

* If you are behind a proxy, follow the instructions in the *Configuring Proxy Support for Kubernetes* section. 

* You must have permissions to create Kubernetes cluster roles and role bindings.



== Note these before you start

If you are running with a <<configuring-proxy-support,proxy>>, have a <<using-a-custom-or-private-docker-repository,custom repository>>, or are using <<openshift-instructions,OpenShift>>, read the following sections carefully.

If you are upgrading from a previous installation, also read the <<upgrading,Upgrading>> information.



=== Configuring Proxy Support

To configure a proxy, first ensure that you have connectivity from the proxy server/VM to your Cloud Insights environment. Simply logging into Cloud Insights from the proxy system means you have a connection.

Before installing the Operator, set the _http_proxy/https_proxy_ environment variables. For some proxy environments, you may also need to set the _no_proxy environment_ variable.

To set the variable(s), perform the following steps *PRIOR* to installing the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator:

. Set the _https_proxy_ and/or _http_proxy_ environment variable(s) for the current user:
+
 export https_proxy=<proxy_server>:<proxy_port>

. Create _/etc/default/telegraf_, and insert definitions for the _https_proxy_ and/or _http_proxy_ variable(s):
+
 https_proxy=<proxy_server>:<proxy_port>


Your proxy configuration is nearly ready to work with Cloud Insights. To finish the configuration, perform the following steps after you install the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator.

First, open the _agent-monitoring-netapp_ file for editing:

 kubectl -n netapp-monitoring edit agent agent-monitoring-netapp

Locate the _*spec:*_ section of this file and add the following code block:

 proxy:
 
 # If an AU is enabled on your cluster for monitoring 
 # by Cloud Insights, then isAuProxyEnabled should be set to true:
  isAuProxyEnabled: <true or false>        
   
 # If your Operator install is behind a corporate proxy, 
 # isTelegrafProxyEnabled should be set to true:
  isTelegrafProxyEnabled: <true or false>  
   
 # If LOGS_COLLECTION is enabled on your cluster for monitoring 
 # by CI, then isFluentbitProxyEnabled should be set to true:
  isFluentbitProxyEnabled: <true or false> 
   
 # Set the following values according to your proxy login:
  password: <password for proxy, optional>
  port: <port for proxy>
  server: <server for proxy>
  username: <username for proxy, optional>
   
 # In the following section, enter a comma-separated list of 
 # IP addresses and/or resolvable hostnames that should bypass
 # the proxy:
  noProxy: <comma separated list>


While installing, there are two places where proxy settings are important:

* Proxy needed during execution of the snippet to connect the system where the snippet is executed to your Cloud Insights environment. the snippet uses "curl" to download what it needs.
* Proxy needed by the target K8s cluster to communicate with your Cloud Insights environment.


The proxies may be the same, but they must be setup and used in two different places during install.

The first proxy, for snippet execution, must be configured on the command line as the snippet is executed. Your proxy settings must be configured to allow execution of the code snippet.

The second proxy, for K8s cluster communication with your Cloud Insights environment, must be configured _after_ the snippet executes and installs the configuration and containers. 




=== Using a custom or private docker repository

If using a custom docker repository, do the following in preparation for installing the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator:

Get the docker secret:

 kubectl -n netapp-monitoring get secret docker -o yaml
 
Copy/paste the value of _.dockerconfigjson:_ from the output of the above command.

Decode the docker secret:

 echo <paste from _.dockerconfigjson:_  output above> | base64 -d
 
The output of this will be in the following JSON format:

 { "auths":
   {"docker.<cluster>.cloudinsights.netapp.com" :
     {"username":"<tenant id>",
      "password":"<password which is the CI API token>",
      "auth"    :"<encoded username:password basic auth token. This is internal to docker>"}
   }
 }

Log in to the docker repository:

 docker login docker.<cluster>.cloudinsights.netapp.com (from step #2) -u <username from step #2>
 password: <password from docker secret step above>

Pull the operator docker image from Cloud Insights:

 docker pull docker.<cluster>.cloudinsights.netapp.com/netapp-monitoring:<version>
 
Find the <version> field using the following command:
 
 kubectl -n netapp-monitoring get deployment monitoring-operator | grep "image:"

Push the operator docker image to your private/local/enterprise docker repository according to your corporate policies.

Download all open source dependencies to your private docker registry. The following open source images need to be downloaded:

 docker.io/telegraf: 1.22.3
 gcr.io/kubebuilder/kube-rbac-proxy: v0.11.0
 k8s.gcr.io/kube-state-metrics/kube-state-metrics: v2.4.2
 
If fluent-bit is enabled, also download:

 docker.io/fluent-bit:1.9.3
 docker.io/kubernetes-event-exporter:0.10

Edit the agent CR to reflect the new docker repo location, disable auto upgrade (if enabled).

 kubectl -n netapp-monitoring edit agent agent-monitoring-netapp
 
 enableAutoUpgrade: false

 docker-repo: <docker repo of the enterprise/corp docker repo>
 dockerRepoSecret: <optional: name of the docker secret of enterprise/corp docker repo, this secret should be already created on the k8s cluster in the same namespace>
 
In the _spec:_ section, make the following changes:
 
 spec:
   telegraf:
     - name: ksm
       substitutions:
         - key: k8s.gcr.io
           value: <same as "docker-repo" field above>




=== OpenShift Instructions

If you are running on OpenShift 4.6 or higher, you must change the "privileged-mode" setting. Run the following command to open the agent for editing. If you are using a namespace other than "netapp-monitoring", specify that namespace in the command line:

 kubectl edit agent agent-monitoring-netapp -n netapp-monitoring
 
In the file, change _privileged-mode: false_ to  _privileged-mode: true_

Openshift may implement an added level of security that may block access to some Kubernetes components. The _SecurityContextConstraint_ is not created as part of the Kubernetes agent install command provided in the Cloud Insights UI, and must be created manually. See the <<securitycontextconstraint,SecurityContextConstraint>> section for more information.

==== SecurityContextConstraint

////
The pods in which the agents run need to have access to the following:

* hostPath
* configMap
* secrets

These Kubernetes objects are automatically created as part of the Kubernetes agent install command provided in the Cloud Insights UI. 
////

Some variants of Kubernetes, such as OpenShift, implement an added level of security that may block access to certain components. The _SecurityContextConstraint_ is not created as part of the Kubernetes agent install command provided in the Cloud Insights UI, and must be created manually. Once created, restart the Telegraf pod(s).

Note: The default namespace for NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator-based installation is _netapp-monitoring_. In commands involving namespace, be sure to specify the correct namespace for your installation.

== Upgrading

NOTE: If you have a previously installed script-based agent, you _must_ upgrade to the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator.



=== Upgrading from script-based agent to NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator

To upgrade the telegraf agent, do the following:

. Make note of your cluster name as recognized by Cloud Insights.  You can view the cluster name by running the following command. If your namespace is not the default (_ci-monitoring_), substitute the appropriate namespace:

 kubectl -n ci-monitoring get cm telegraf-conf -o jsonpath='{.data}' |grep "kubernetes_cluster ="
 
. Back up the existing configurations:

 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring get cm -o yaml > /tmp/telegraf-configs.yaml

//. <<uninstalling, Uninstall>> the existing agent.

//. <<installing-the-netapp-kubernetes-monitoring-operator, Install>> the new Operator.

. Save the K8s cluster name for use during installation of the K8s operator-based monitoring solution to ensure data continuity.
+
If you do not remember the name of the K8s cluster in CI, it can be extracted from your saved configuration with the following command line:
+
 cat /tmp/telegraf-configs.yaml | grep kubernetes_cluster | head -2
 
. Remove the script-based monitoring 
+
To uninstall the script-based agent on Kubernetes, do the following:
+
If the monitoring namespace is being used solely for Telegraf:
+
 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete ds,rs,cm,sa,clusterrole,clusterrolebinding -l app=ci-telegraf
+
 kubectl delete ns ci-monitoring
+
If the monitoring namespace is being used for other purposes in addition to Telegraf:
+
 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete ds,rs,cm,sa,clusterrole,clusterrolebinding -l app=ci-telegraf
 
. <<installing-the-netapp-kubernetes-monitoring-operator, Install>> the current Operator. 

//image:KubernetesOperatorTile.png[Tile for Kubernetes Operator]


=== Upgrading to the latest the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator

For Operator-based installation run the following commands:

* Make note of your cluster name as recognized by Cloud Insights. You can view the cluster name by running the following command. If your namespace is not the default (_netapp-monitoring_), substitute the appropriate namespace:

 kubectl -n netapp-monitoring get agent -o jsonpath='{.items[0].spec.cluster-name}'


* Back up the existing configurations:

 kubectl --namespace netapp-monitoring get cm -o yaml > /tmp/telegraf-configs.yaml


<<to-remove-the-netapp-kubernetes-monitoring-operator, Uninstall>> the current Operator.

<<installing-the-netapp-kubernetes-monitoring-operator, Install>> the Operator. Use the same cluster name, and ensure you are pulling new container images if you have set up a custom repo.






== Installing the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator

image:Kubernetes_Operator_Agent_Instructions.png[Operator-Based Install]

.Steps to install NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator agent on Kubernetes:

. Enter the cluster name and namespace.
. Once these are entered, you can copy the Agent Installer snippet
. Click the button to copy this snippet to the clipboard.
. Paste the snippet into a _bash_ window and execute it.
. The installation proceeds automatically. When it is complete, click the _Complete Setup_ button.

NOTE: Setup is incomplete until you <<configuring-proxy-support, configure your proxy>>.

NOTE: If you have a custom repository, you must follow the instructions for <<using-a-custom-or-private-docker-repository, Using a custom/private docker repository>>.



 
== Stopping and Starting the Netapp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator
 
To stop the Netapp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator:

 kubectl -n netapp-monitoring scale deploy monitoring-operator --replicas=0

To start the Netapp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator:

 kubectl -n netapp-monitoring scale deploy monitoring-operator --replicas=1




 



== About Kube-state-metrics

The NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator installs kube-state-metrics automatically; no user interaction is needed unless you wish to export Kubernetes object labels.

NOTE: Note that with kube-state-metrics version 2.0 and above, Kubernetes object labels are not exported by default. To configure kube-state-metrics to export Kubernetes object labels, you must specify a metric labels "allow" list. Refer to the _--metric-labels-allowlist_ option in the link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/blob/master/docs/cli-arguments.md[kube-state-metrics documentation].

== Uninstalling

NOTE: If you are running on a previously-installed script-based Kubernetes agent, you must <<upgrading, upgrade>> to the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator.



=== To remove the older script-based agent

Note that these commands are using the default namespace "ci-monitoring".  If you have set your own namespace, substitute that namespace in these and all subsequent commands and files.

To uninstall the script-based agent on Kubernetes (for example, when upgrading to the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator), do the following:

If the monitoring namespace is being used solely for Telegraf:

 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete ds,rs,cm,sa,clusterrole,clusterrolebinding -l app=ci-telegraf
 
 kubectl delete ns ci-monitoring

//For the commands above, use “_netapp-monitoring_” if you installed using operator-based installation with the default namespace.
 
If the monitoring namespace is being used for other purposes in addition to Telegraf:

 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete ds,rs,cm,sa,clusterrole,clusterrolebinding -l app=ci-telegraf



=== To remove the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator

Note that the default namespace for the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator is "netapp-monitoring".  If you have set your own namespace, substitute that namespace in these and all subsequent commands and files.

Execute each of the following commands in order. Depending on your current installation, some of these commands may return ‘object not found’ messages. These messages may be safely ignored.


  kubectl -n <NAMESPACE> delete agent agent-monitoring-netapp
  kubectl delete crd agents.monitoring.netapp.com
  kubectl -n <NAMESPACE> delete role agent-leader-election-role  
  kubectl delete clusterrole agent-manager-role agent-proxy-role agent-metrics-reader <NAMESPACE>-agent-manager-role <NAMESPACE>-agent-proxy-role <NAMESPACE>-cluster-role-privileged
  kubectl delete clusterrolebinding agent-manager-rolebinding agent-proxy-rolebinding agent-cluster-admin-rolebinding <NAMESPACE>-agent-manager-rolebinding <NAMESPACE>-agent-proxy-rolebinding <NAMESPACE>-cluster-role-binding-privileged
  kubectl delete <NAMESPACE>-psp-nkmo
  kubectl delete ns <NAMESPACE>


If a Security Context Constraint was previously-created manually for a script-based Telegraf installation:

 kubectl delete scc telegraf-hostaccess
 
 
 


////
== Verifying Kubernetes Checksums


The Cloud Insights agent installer performs integrity checks, but some users may want to perform their own verifications before installing or applying downloaded artifacts. To perform a download-only operation (as opposed to the default download-and-install), these users can edit the agent installation command obtained from the UI and remove the trailing “install” option.

Follow these steps:

. Copy the Agent Installer snippet as directed.
. Instead of pasting the snippet into a command window, paste it into a text editor.
. Remove the trailing “--install” (Linux/Mac) or “-install” (Windows) from the command.
. Copy the entire command from the text editor.
. Now paste it into your command window (in a working directory) and run it.

Non-Windows (these examples are for Kubernetes; actual script names may vary):

* Download and install (default):

 installerName=cloudinsights-kubernetes.sh … && sudo -E -H ./$installerName --download –-install

* Download-only:

 installerName=cloudinsights-kubernetes.sh … && sudo -E -H ./$installerName --download


The download-only command will download all required artifacts from Cloud Insights to the working directory.  The artifacts include, but may not be limited to: 

* an installation script
* an environment file
* YAML files
* a signed checksum file (sha256.signed)
* a PEM file (netapp_cert.pem) for signature verification



The installation script, environment file, and YAML files can be verified using visual inspection. 



The PEM file can be verified by confirming its fingerprint to be the following:

 E5:FB:7B:68:C0:8B:1C:A9:02:70:85:84:C2:74:F8:EF:C7:BE:8A:BC

More specifically,

*	Non-Windows:

 openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha1 -noout -inform pem -in netapp_cert.pem

*	Windows:

 Import-Certificate -Filepath .\netapp_cert.pem -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\Root




The signed checksum file can be verified using the PEM file:

*	Non-Windows:

 openssl smime -verify -in sha256.signed -CAfile netapp_cert.pem -purpose any

*	Windows (after installing the certificate via Import-Certificate above):

 Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath .\sha256.ps1 $result = Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath .\sha256.ps1 $signer = $result.SignerCertificate Add-Type -Assembly System.Security [Security.Cryptography.x509Certificates.X509Certificate2UI]::DisplayCertificate($signer)



Once all of the artifacts have been satisfactorily verified, the agent installation can be initiated by running:

Non-Windows:

 sudo -E -H ./<installation_script_name> --install

Windows:

 .\cloudinsights-windows.ps1 -install
////
 




== Troubleshooting Kubernetes Installation

Some things to try if you encounter problems setting up the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:

|For clusters where _etcd_ is not the Kubernetes cluster datastore, You will see the following message in the telegraf RS pod:

 [inputs.prometheus] Error in plugin: could not load keypair /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt:/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key: open /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt: no such file or directory
|Cloud Insights only supports monitoring of _etcd_ as the K8s datastore. You can modify the agent to avoid collecting etcd data by changing the configuration with the following instructions:  

 kubectl -n netapp-monitoring edit agent agent-monitoring-netapp

In that file, delete the following section:

 - name: prometheus_etcd
   run-mode:
   - ReplicaSet




|I do not see a hyperlink/connection between my Kubernetes Persistent Volume and the corresponding back-end storage device. My Kubernetes Persistent Volume is configured using the hostname of the storage server.
|Follow the steps to uninstall the existing Telegraf agent, then re-install the latest Telegraf agent. You must be using Telegraf version 2.0 or later.

|I'm seeing messages in the logs resembling the following:

E0901 15:21:39.962145 1 reflector.go:178] k8s.io/kube-state-metrics/internal/store/builder.go:352: Failed to list *v1.MutatingWebhookConfiguration: the server could not find the requested resource
E0901 15:21:43.168161 1 reflector.go:178] k8s.io/kube-state-metrics/internal/store/builder.go:352: Failed to list *v1.Lease: the server could not find the requested resource (get leases.coordination.k8s.io)
etc.


|These messages may occur if you are running kube-state-metrics version 2.0.0 or above with Kubernetes version 1.17 or below.


To get the Kubernetes version:

 _kubectl version_

To get the kube-state-metrics version:

 _kubectl get deploy/kube-state-metrics -o jsonpath='{..image}'_

To prevent these messages from happening, users can modify their kube-state-metrics deployment to disable the following Leases:

_mutatingwebhookconfigurations_
_validatingwebhookconfigurations_
_volumeattachments resources_

More specifically, they can use the following CLI argument:

resources=certificatesigningrequests,configmaps,cronjobs,daemonsets, deployments,endpoints,horizontalpodautoscalers,ingresses,jobs,limitranges, namespaces,networkpolicies,nodes,persistentvolumeclaims,persistentvolumes, poddisruptionbudgets,pods,replicasets,replicationcontrollers,resourcequotas, secrets,services,statefulsets,storageclasses

The default resource list is:

"certificatesigningrequests,configmaps,cronjobs,daemonsets,deployments, endpoints,horizontalpodautoscalers,ingresses,jobs,leases,limitranges, mutatingwebhookconfigurations,namespaces,networkpolicies,nodes, persistentvolumeclaims,persistentvolumes,poddisruptionbudgets,pods,replicasets, replicationcontrollers,resourcequotas,secrets,services,statefulsets,storageclasses, validatingwebhookconfigurations,volumeattachments"

|I installed or upgraded Telegraf on Kubernetes, but the Telegraf pods are not starting up.  The Telegraf ReplicaSet or DaemonSet is reporting a failure resembling the following:

 Error creating: pods "telegraf-rs-" is forbidden": unable to validate against any security context constraint: [spec.volumes[2]: Invalid value: "hostPath": hostPath volumes are not allowed to be used]

|Create a Security Context Constraint (refer to the _SecurityContextConstraint_ section above) if one does not already exist.

Ensure the namespace and service account specified for the Security Context Constraint matches the namespace and service account for the Telegraf ReplicaSet and DaemonSet.

|This is a known issue.  Refer to link:https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/issues/9407[This GitHub article] for more details. As long as Telegraf is up and running, users can ignore these error messages.

|On Kubernetes, my Telegraf pod(s) are reporting the following error:
"Error in processing mountstats info: failed to open mountstats file: /hostfs/proc/1/mountstats, error: open /hostfs/proc/1/mountstats: permission denied"
|If SELinux is enabled and enforcing, it is likely preventing the Telegraf pod(s) from accessing the /proc/1/mountstats file on the Kubernetes nodes.  To relax this restriction, do ONE of the following:

• Edit the agent (`kubectl edit agent agent-monitoring-netapp`), and change "privileged-mode: false" to "privileged-mode: true"


|On Kubernetes, my Telegraf ReplicaSet pod is reporting the following error:

 [inputs.prometheus] Error in plugin: could not load keypair /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt:/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key: open /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt: no such file or directory
|The Telegraf ReplicaSet pod is intended to run on a node designated as a master or for etcd. If the ReplicaSet pod is not running on one of these nodes, you will get these errors. Check to see if your master/etcd nodes have taints on them. If they do, add the necessary tolerations to the Telegraf ReplicaSet, telegraf-rs.

For example, edit the ReplicaSet...

 kubectl edit rs telegraf-rs

...and add the appropriate tolerations to the spec. Then, restart the ReplicaSet pod.

|I have a PSP environment. Does this affect my monitoring operator?
|If your Kubernetes cluster is running with Pod Security Policy (PSP) in place, you must upgrade to the latest NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator. Follow these steps to upgrade to the current NKMO with support for PSP:

1. Uninstall the previous monitoring operator:
