Data Infrastructure Insights uses the Azure NetApp Files data collector to acquire inventory and performance data. 

== Requirements

You need the following information to configure this data collector.

* Port requirement: 443 HTTPS
* Azure Management Rest IP (management.azure.com) 
* Azure service principal client ID (user account)
* Azure service principal authentication key (user password)
* You need to set up an Azure account for Data Infrastructure Insights discovery. 
+
Once the account is properly configured and you register the application in Azure, you will have the credentials required to discover the Azure instance with Data Infrastructure Insights. The following link describes how to set up the account for discovery:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal

== Configuration

Enter data into the data collector fields according to the table below:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Field | Description
|Azure Service Principal Client ID|Sign-in ID to Azure 
|Azure Tenant ID|Azure Tenant ID
|Azure Service Principal Authentication Key|Login authentication key 
|I understand Microsoft bills me for API requests|Check this to verify your understanding that Microsoft bills you for API requests made by Insight polling.
|===

== Advanced Configuration

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Field | Description
|Inventory Poll Interval (min)|The default is 60
//|HTTP connection and socket timeout (sec)|The default is 300

//|Choose 'Exclude' or 'Include' to Apply to Filter VMs by Tags|Specify whether to include or exclude VM's by Tags when collecting data. If ‘Include’ is selected, the Tag Key field can not be empty. 
//|Tag Keys and Values on which to Filter VMs|Click *+ Filter Tag* to choose which VMs (and associated disks) to include/exclude by filtering for keys and values that match keys and values of tags on the VM. Tag Key is required, Tag Value is optional. When Tag Value is empty, the VM is filtered as long as it matches the Tag Key.
//|Performance Poll Interval (sec)|The default is 300
|===

           
== Troubleshooting

* The credentials used by your ANF data collector must have access to any Azure subscriptions that contain ANF volumes.
* If Reader access causes performance collection to fail, try granting contributor access on a resource group level.
