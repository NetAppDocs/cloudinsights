[#whats-new]
[.lead]
NetApp is continually improving and enhancing its products and services. Here are some of the latest features and functionalities available in the commercial Editions of Cloud Insights.  


== May 2024

=== Automatically resolve alerts based on time

Log alerts can now be resolved based on time; if the alert condition stops occurring, Cloud Insights can resolve the alert automatically after a specified time has passed. You can choose to resolve the alert in minutes, hours, or days.

image:alerts_resolve_based_on_time.png[Resolve an alert based on time passed]


'''


== April 2024


=== iSCSI support for Kubernetes

Cloud Insights now has support to map the iSCSI storage associated with Kubernetes, allowing faster troubleshooting using the Kubernetes network map and the ability to provide chargeback or showback reports via Reporting.

image:pod-to-storage.png[Pod-to-storage example]



=== Operating System support

The following operating systems are supported with Cloud Insights Acquisition Units, in addition to those link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/concept_acquisition_unit_requirements.html[already supported]:

* Oracle Enterprise Linux 8.8
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.8
* Rocky 9.3
* OpenSUSE Leap 15.1 through 15.5
* SUSE Enterprise Linux Server 15, 15 SP2 through 15 SP5



'''
== March 2024

=== Workload Security Agent Details

Each of your Workload Security Agents has its own landing page, where you can easily see summary information about the Agent as well as the installed Data and User Directory Collectors associated with that Agent. 

image:Agent_Detail_Page.png[Agent Detail Landing Page example]

=== Chart more data more quickly

When analyzing data on an asset's landing page, adding additional data to the Expert View charts is a snap. For each table on the landing page, if an object type has relevant data, hover over that object to display the "Add to Expert View" icon. Selecting this icon adds that object to the Additional Resources and displays it in the Expert View charts.

image:AddToChartIcon.png[Add table data to expert view]

Or maybe you want to see a landing page table's data in its own chart. Simply select the _Show Chart_ icon to open the chart below the table:

image:LPTableShowChartIcon.png[Show Chart icon]


'''

== February 2024


=== Usability Improvements

Save a *snapshot* of your current dashboard by selecting _Export as Image_ from the right-corner drop-down. Cloud Insights creates a .PNG of the current widget states.

image:ExportAsImage.png[Export as Image Dropdown]


*Object and Metric selection* is easier than ever for Widgets, Monitors, etc.  Choose the object type you want, and then select a metric relevant to that object in the separate drop-down.

image:ObjectAndMetricSelection.png[Object and Metric Selectors separate]


*Export Data Collector and Acquisition Unit* lists to .CSV by selecting the icon at the top of those pages. 

image:ExportDCList.png[Export DC and AU Lists to .csv]


We’ve *re-organized the Help > Support* page so it’s easier to find what you’re looking for, and because you asked for them, we added direct links on this page to *API Swagger* and user documentation.

image:Support_APIAccess.png[API Links on the Help > Support Page]


*Links* in the “triggeredOn” column on the Alerts list page will navigate to the appropriate Landing Page, if a Landing Page is available for that object.

image:TriggeredOnLink.png[Links in TriggeredOn alert field]




=== See all changes in your namespace

Kubernetes Change Analysis now allows you to see a timeline of changes when selecting Cluster and Namespace. Previously, Workload must also have been selected.  When filtering on Cluster and Namespace, the timeline of all workload changes in that namespace are shown on one line.

image:NamespaceTimeline.png[Namespace Timeline]
 


=== Related Logs for Alerts

When viewing a log alert, related log entries are shown in a new table.  A log entry is related if it occurs in the same source and timeframe as the alert, and is subject to the same conditions. Select “Analyze Logs” to explore further.

image:RelatedLogsTable.png[Related Logs on a log alert landing page]


=== Collect ONTAP Switch Data

Cloud Insights can collect data from the ONTAP system’s back-end switches; simply enable the collection in the data collector’s _Advanced Configuration_ section, and ensure the ONTAP system is configured to provide link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap-cli-98/system-switch-ethernet-create.html[switch information] and has the appropriate link:task_dc_na_cdot.html#a-note-about-permissions[permissions] set.







=== Workload Security Data Collector API

In large environments, you can automate Workload Security collector creation using the new Data Collectors API. Navigate to *Admin > API Access > API Documentation* and select the _Workload Security_ API type to learn more.

'''

== January 2024

=== Try Cloud Insights Features you haven’t used yet

In addition to your initial trial of Cloud Insights, you may also take advantage of link:concept_subscribing_to_cloud_insights.html#module-evaluation[Module Evaluations]. For example, if you are subscribed to Cloud Insights and have been monitoring storage and virtual machines, when you add Kubernetes to your environment, you will automatically enter into a 30-day trial of Kubernetes Observability. Kubernetes Observability managed unit usage will not count against your subscribed entitlement until after the trial period ends.

=== How healthy are my workloads?

Workload health is available at a glance on the *Kubernetes > Explore > Workloads* page, so you can quickly see which workloads are performing well and which may need some help. Easily identify if the health issue is related to infrastructure, network, or configuration changes, and drill down to analyze the root cause.

image:WorkloadHealth.png[Workload Health at a glance]


=== Data Collector Updates

==== Data Domain Identification

The Data Domain collector has been improved to better identify HA systems for durability across failover events This change will cause a *one time* re-identification of Data Domain appliances in HA systems, which will subsequently cause any annotations on those assets to be removed (because these arrays will be re-identified). You will need to re-attach annotations to your Data Domain objects.


=== Enhanced Ransomware Detection ML Algorithm

Workload Security includes a new 2nd-generation ransomware detection ML algorithm to detect the most sophisticated attacks faster and more accurately.

"Seasonality" of behaviors: weekend behavior may follow different patterns from weekday, or morning behavior from afternoon. Workload Security algorithms take this seasonality into account.

// * Faster analytics: The forensics user interface has been improved to analyze more data more quickly.




=== Deprecated Functionality

Occasionally functionality is deprecated as features evolve. Here are some of the features and functionalities which have been deprecated in Cloud Insights:

==== Workload Secure REST cloudsecure_forensics.activities.v1 API is deprecated

The _cloudsecure_forensics.activities.v1_ API is deprecated. This API returns information on activities associated with entities in the Storage Workload Security environment. This API has been replaced with cloudsecure_forensics.activities.*v2*_.  

GET for this API previously returned the following: 

----
{ 
  "count": 24594, 
  "limit": 1000, 
  "offset": 0, 
  "results": [ 
    { 
      "accessLocation": 
----

This API now returns:

----
{ 
  "limit": 1000, 
  "meta": { 
    "page": { 
      "after": "lvlvk3pp.4cpzcg4kpybl", 
      "before": "lvlxy3dz.4cq5ajdnl9fk", 
      "size": 1000 
    } 
  }, 
  "results": [ 
    { 
      "accessLocation": "10.249.6.220", 
----

//There was a change in the backend for performance optimization. Hence in order to accommodate the change the response body had to be changed as maintaining the previous response would have affected the performance. Count & limit are replaced with meta. 

For more details see the Swagger documentation at “Admin > API Access > API Documentation > Workload Security”. 

//This API is no longer supported from Jan 2024 in all regions. 



'''


== December 2023

=== Change Analytics at a glance

Kubernetes link:kubernetes_change_analytics.html[Change Analytics] provide you with an all-in-one view of recent changes to your Kubernetes environment. Alerts and deployment status are at your fingertips. With Change Analytics, you can track every deployment and configuration change, and correlate it with the health and performance of K8s services, infrastructure, and clusters.

image:ChangeAnalytitcs_Main_Screen.png[Change Analytics Dashboard]


=== Kubernetes Workload Performance Dashboard

Workload performance is available at a glance in the comprehensive Kubernetes Workload Performance dashboard. Quickly view graphs of Volume, Throughput, Latency, and Retransmission trends, as well as a table of workload traffic for each namespace in your environment. Filters allow easy focus into areas of interest.

image:K8s_Workload_performance.png[Workload Performance Menu, width=400]

image:K8s_Workload_performance_dashboard.png[Workload Performance Dashboard]


=== Query Details on one screen

In a query, selecting a row opens a side panel showing attribute, annotation, and metric details for the selected row, providing helpful information without needing to drill into the object's landing page. Links in the row or side panel allow for easy navigation.

image:MetricQuerySlideoutPanel.png[Slideout Panel for Metric Query]



=== Data Collector updates:

* *Brocade FOS REST*:  This collector is moved out of "Preview" and is now generally available. Some things to note:
** FOS introduced their REST API with FOS 8.2. But some features like routing only received REST API capabilities with 9.0.
** If you have a fabric consisting of mixed FOS assets 8.2 higher, as well as some < 8.2, the Cloud Insights FOS REST collector will fail to discover those older assets. You can edit the FOS REST collector and build a comma-delimited list of the IPv4 address of those devices for exclusion from that collector.

* *SELinux*:  Cloud Insights includes enhancements to the Linux Acquisition Unit initial installation to ensure robustness of operation within Linux environments with SELinux enforcement enabled. These enhancements only impact _new_ AU deployments; if you have any SELinux issues relating to AU upgrades, contact NetApp Support to remediate your SELinux configuration.


'''


== November 2023

=== Workload Security: Pause/Resume a Collector

In Workload Security, you can Pause a Data Collector if the collector is in _Running_ state. Open the "three dots" menu for the collector and select PAUSE. While the collector is paused, no data is gathered from ONTAP, and no data is sent from the collector to ONTAP. Select Resume to begin collecting again.

=== Storage Node Support Information

On a storage node landing page, the _User Data_ section provides at-a-glance information about your support offering, current status, support status, and warranty end date. Note that Cloud Insights currently only auto-publishes this information for NetApp devices. Note also that these support fields are annotations, so they can be used in queries and dashboards.


image:StorageNodeSupportData.png[Storage Node Support Information]


=== Map VMWare tags to Cloud Insights annotations

The link:task_dc_vmware.html#mapping-vmware-tags-to-cloud-insights-annotations[VMWare] data collector allows you to populate Cloud Insights text annotations with same-name tags that are configured on VMWare. 

=== Brocade CLI collector reliability enhancements for FOS 9.1.1c and higher firmware

On some Brocade Fibre Channel switches running 9.1.1c firmware, certain CLI commands’ output may be prepended with the “motd” login banner text, or warnings for users to change default passwords. The Brocade CLI collector has been enhanced to ignore these two types of extraneous text.

Prior to this enhancement, only FOS 9.1.1c switches without Virtual Fabrics present were likely discoverable with this collector type.



'''


== October 2023


=== Enhanced Workload Security 

Workload Security has been improved with the following:

* *Access Denied*: Workload Security integrates with ONTAP to receive link:concept_ws_integration_with_ontap_access_denied.html["Access Denied" events] and provide an additional analytics and automatic responses layer.
* *Allowed File Types*: If a ransomware attack is detected for a known file extension, that file extension can be added to an link:ws_allowed_file_types.html[allowed file types] list to prevent unnecessary alerting. 



=== Module Trials

In addition to your initial trial of Cloud Insights, you may also take advantage of link:concept_subscribing_to_cloud_insights.html#module-evaluation[Module Evaluations]. For example, if you are already subscribed to Infrastructure Observability but are adding Kubernetes to your environment, you will automatically enter into a 30-day trial of Kubernetes Observability. You will only be charged for your Kubernetes Observability managed unit usage at the end of the evaluation period.


=== Restrict access to specified domains

Admins and Account Owners now have the ability to link:concept_user_roles.html#restricting-access-by-domain[restrict Cloud Insights access] to email domains they specify. Go to *Admin > User Management* and select the _Restrict Domains_ button.  

image:Restrict_Domains_Modal.png[Restrict Domains Modal]



=== Data Collector Updates

The following Data Collector/Acquisition Unit changes are in place:

* *Isilon / PowerScale REST*: Various new attributes and metrics have been added to Cloud Insights enhanced analytics capabilities under the _emc_isilon.node_pool.*_ name. These counters and attributes will empower users to build dashboards and monitors for _node_pool_ capacity consumption; users with Isilon clusters built from dissimilar hardware node models will have multiple node pools, and understanding your HDD/SSD/total capacity consumption at a node pool level is useful for both monitoring and planning.

* *Rubrik* “Service account” authentication support: Cloud Insights' Rubrik collector now supports both traditional HTTP Basic Authentication (username and password), and Rubrik’s Service Account approach, which requires a username + secret + Organization ID. 




'''

== September 2023



=== Easily Find What You Want in the Logs

Log Query (*Observability > Log Queries > +New Log Query*) includes a number of link:concept_log_explorer.html#advanced-filtering[enhancements] to make log exploration easier and more informative. 



==== Include/Exclude

When filtering for a value, you can easily choose whether to *Include* or *Exclude* results matching the filter. Selecting "Exclude" creates a "NOT <value>" filter. You can combine Include and Exclude values in a single filter.

image:Log_Query_Exclude_Filter.png[Filter showing Exclude radio button]




==== Advanced Query

*Advanced Querying* gives you the opportunity to create "free form" filters, combining or excluding values using AND, NOT, OR, wildcards, etc.

image:Log_Advanced_Query_Example.png[Example Log Query illustrating AND, NOT and OR functions]

The "Filter By" and Advanced Query are "AND"ed together to form a single query. The results are displayed in the results list and the chart.



==== Grouping in the Chart

When you select a log attribute to *Group By*, the list and chart show the results of the current filter. In the chart, columns grouped into colors. Hovering over a column in the chart will display details about the specific entries, similar to the overall information shown when you expand the chart Legend.  In the legend, you can also choose to set an Include or Exclude filter for a specific grouping.

image:Log_Query_Group_By_Chart.png[Log Query Group By example showing stacked columns in the chart] 



=== "Floating" Log Detail Panel

When exploring logs using the Log Query, selecting an entry in the list opens a detail panel for that entry. You can now choose to display that slideout panel "Floating" (i.e. displayed over the rest of the screen) or 'In Page" (i.e. displayed as its own frame within the page). To switch between these views, select the "In Page / Floating" button in the upper-right corner of the panel.

image:Log_Query_Floating_Detail_Panel.png["In-Page" slideout panel with button highlighted]


=== Collapse the Menu

You can collapse the left-side Cloud Insights navigation menu by selecting the "Minimize" button below the menu. While the menu is minimized, hover over an icon to see which section it opens; selecting the icon opens the menu and takes you directly to that section.

image:CI_Menu_Minimize_Button.png[Minimize the menu]


=== Data Collector Improvements

Cloud Insights has made it easier to show and find data collector information:

* *Processing of data collector lists* is more efficient, which means the time it takes to display and navigate these lists is greatly reduced. If you have a large environment with many data collectors, you will see a significant improvement when listing your data collectors.

//=== .HTML-based Data Collector Support Matrix

* The *Data Collector Support Matrix* has moved from a .PDF file to an .HTML-based page, quicker to navigate and easier to maintain. Check out the new Matrix here: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/reference_data_collector_support_matrix.html 






'''



== August 2023


=== Collecting Isilon/PowerScale Logs and Advanced Analytics Data

The Isilon REST and PowerScale REST collectors contain the following improvements:

* Isilon log events are available for use in queries and alerts

* Isilon Advanced Analytic attributes are available for use in queries, dashboards, and alerts:
** emc_isilon.cluster
** emc_isilon.node
** emc_isilon.node_disk
** emc_isilon.net_iface

These are enabled by default for users of the Isilon REST and/or PowerScale REST collectors. NetApp strongly encourages users of the Isilon CLI-based collector to migrate to the new REST API-based collector to receive enhancements such as the above.



=== Improved Workload Map

The workload map is more usable and less noisy; it groups all similar external services into one node if they communicate with the same workloads, reducing the complexity of the graph and making it easier to understand how services are interconnected.

Choosing a grouped node will display a detailed table with the network traffic metrics for each external service relevant to that node.




=== Kubernetes Managed Unit usage adjustment

In the event of a compute resource in your Kubernetes cluster environment being counted by both the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator and an underlying infrastructure data collector (for example, VMware), your usage of these resources will be adjusted to ensure the most efficient counting of managed units. You can view the Kubernetes MU adjustments on the Admin > Subscription page, in both the Summary and Usage tabs.

Summary tab:
image:MU_Adjustments_K8s.png[k8s MU Adjustment shown on the estimation calculator]

Usage tab:
image:MU_Adjustments_K8s_Usage_Tab.png[k8s MU Adjustment shown on the Usage tab]




=== Collector/Acquisition changes:

The following Data Collector/Acquisition Unit changes are in place:

* Acquisition Units now support RHEL 8.7.




=== Improved Menus

We have updated the left hand navigation menu to better support our customers' workflows. New top level items such as _Kubernetes_ provide accelerated access to what the customer needs, and a consolidated administrators console supports the tenant owner role. 

Here are some additional examples of the changes:

* The top level _Observability_ menu showcases data discovery, alerting and log queries
*	‘API Access’ functionality for Observability and Workload Security are under one menu

=== Improved Kubernetes Monitoring Operator Installation

Installation and configuration of the link:task_config_telegraf_agent_k8s.html[NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator] is easier than ever with the following improvements:

* Environment link:telegraf_agent_k8s_config_options.html[configuration settings] are held in a single, self-documented config file.
* Step-by step instructions for uploading Kubernetes Monitoring Operator images to your private repository.
* Simple to upgrade with a single command to upgrade your Kubernetes Monitoring while keeping custom configurations.
* More secured: API keys are securely managing secrets.
* Easy to integrate and deploy with your CI/CD automation tools.


=== Storage Virtualization

Cloud Insights can differentiate between a storage array having local storage or virtualization of other storage arrays. This gives you the ability to relate cost and distinguish performance from the front-end all the way to the back-end of your infrastructure.

image:StorageVirtualization_StorageSummary.png[Storage Landing Page showing Virtual and backed storage information]




=== New Webhook Parameters

When creating a link:task_create_webhook.html[Webhook] notification, you can now include these parameters in your webhook definition:

* %%TriggeredOnKeys%%
* %%TriggeredOnValues%%



=== Reporting on Kubernetes data

//Cloud Insights can now do Reporting on all Kubernetes data including PV, PVC, Workload, Cluster, and Namespace.

Kubernetes data collected by Cloud Insights--including Persistent Volumes (PV), PVC, Workloads, Clusters, and Namespaces--is now available for use in Reporting, enabling chargeback, trending, forecasting, TTF calculations, and other business reporting on metrics for Kubernetes.

//Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) information collected by Cloud Insights is now available for use in Reporting, enabling chargeback, trending, forecasting, TTF calculations, and other business reporting on metrics for Kubernetes clusters, namespaces, workloads, and more.

//Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) information collected by Cloud Insights is now available for use in Reporting, enabling visibility of K8S clusters from the physical host to the backend storage for chargeback/showback and migrations.



=== Default ONTAP System Monitors Enabled for New Customers

Many ONTAP System Monitors are enabled (i.e. _Resumed_) by default in new Cloud Insights environments. Previously, most monitors defaulted to _Paused_ state. Because business needs vary from company to company, we always recommend taking a look at the link:task_system_monitors.html[system monitors] in your environment and pausing or resuming each based on your alerting needs.



//=== Cold Data Customer 


////
=== Improved Workload Security navigation

////



'''

== April 2023


=== Kubernetes Performance Monitoring and Map

The link:concept_kubernetes_network_monitoring_and_map.html[_Kubernetes Network Performance and Map_] feature simplifies troubleshooting by mapping dependencies between Kubernetes workloads. It provides real-time visibility into Kubernetes network performance latencies and anomalies to identify performance issues before they affect users.
This capability helps organizations reduce overall costs by analyzing and auditing Kubernetes traffic flows.
 
Key Features:
•	The Workload Map presents Kubernetes workload dependencies and flows and highlights network and performance issues.
•	Monitor network traffic between Kubernetes pods, workloads, and nodes; identifies the source of traffic and latency problems.
•	Reduce overall costs by analyzing ingress, egress, cross-region, and cross-zone network traffic. 

Workload Map showing "Slideout" details:

image:Workload Map Example_withSlideout.png[Workload Map example showing "Slideout" panel with details]

Kubernetes Performance Monitoring and Map is available as a link:concept_preview_features.html[Preview] feature.



=== ONTAP Essentials Security Dashboard

The link:concept_ontap_essentials.html#security[Security Dashboard] gives you an instant view of your current security situation, showing charts for hardware and software volume encryption, anti-ransomware status, and cluster authentication methods. The Security Dashboard is available as a link:concept_preview_features.html[Preview] feature.

image:OE_SecurityDashboard.png[ONTAP Essentials Security Dashboard]




=== Reclaim ONTAP Cold Storage

The _Reclaim ONTAP Cold Storage_ Insight provides data about cold capacity, potential cost/power savings, and recommended action items for volumes on ONTAP systems. 

image:Cold_Data_Example_1.png[Cold Data Insight example recommednations]

With this Insight, you can answer such questions as:

* What amount of cold data on a storage cluster are sitting on (a) high-cost SSD disks, (b) HDD disks, and (c) virtual disks?
* What workloads are the highest contributors in regards of the non-optimized storage?
* What is the duration (in days) the data has been cold on a given workload?

_Reclaim ONTAP Cold Storage_ is considered a link:concept_preview_features.html[_Preview_] feature and is therefore subject to change.



=== Subscription Notification also controls banner messages

Setting recipients for Subscription Notifications (Admin > Notifications) now also controls who will see subscription-related in-product banner notifications. 

image:Subscription_Expiring_Banner.png[Subscription Expiring in 2 Days banner example]



=== Reporting has a new look 

You will notice that Cloud Insights Reporting screens have a new look, and that some of the menu navigation have changed. These screens and navigation changes have been updated in the current link:reporting_overview.html[Reporting Documentation]. 

image:Reporting_Menu.png[New Reporting Menu look]



=== Monitors Paused by Default

For new Cloud Insights environments, be aware that link:task_system_monitors.html[system-defined monitors] do not send alert notifications by default. You will need to enable notifications for any monitor that you want alerting you, by adding one or more delivery methods for the monitor.
For existing Cloud Insights environments, the default _global_ notification recipient list has been removed for any system-defined monitors currently in _Paused_ state. User-defined notifications remain unchanged, as do notification settings for currently active system-defined monitors.



=== Looking for the API Metering tab?

API Metering has moved from the Subscription page to the *Admin > API Access* page.


'''


== March 2023

=== Cloud Connection for ONTAP 9.9+ deprecated

The Cloud Connection for ONTAP 9.9+ data collector is being deprecated.  Starting April 4, 2023, Cloud Connection data collectors in your environment will no longer collect data, and will instead present an error when polling. The Cloud Connection data collector will be removed altogether from Cloud Insights in a subsequent update.

Prior to April 4, 2023, it is mandatory to configure a new NetApp ONTAP Data Management Software data collector for any ONTAP systems currently collected by Cloud Connection. link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Cloud_Services/Cloud_Insights/How_to_transition_from_NetApp_Cloud_Connection_to_AU_based_data_collector[Learn More].


'''



== January 2023

=== New Log Monitors

We've added almost two dozen link:task_system_monitors.html[additional system monitors] to alert for broken interconnect links, heartbeat problems, and more. Additionally, three new Data Protection log monitors have been added, to alert on SnapMirror Auto Resync, MetroCluster Mirroring, and FabricPool Mirror Resync changes.

Note that some of these monitors will be _enabled_ by default; you must _pause_ them if you do not wish to alert on them. Also note that these monitors are not configured to deliver notifications; you must configure notification recipients on these monitors if you want to send alerts via email or webhook.

=== .CSV Export for all Dashboard Table Widgets

Ensuring accessibility to your data is essential, so we've made .CSV export available for all metric queries, dashboard table widgets, and object landing pages, regardless of the type of data (asset or integration) you're querying. 

Data customizations like column selection, renaming columns, and unit conversions are also now included in the new export functionality.


'''

image:Agent_Checksum_Instructions.png[Agent Checksum values shown during installation]


=== Log Alerting Improvements

==== Group By
When creating or editing a Log Monitor, you can now set "Group By" attributes to allow for more focused alerting. Look for the "Group By" attributes below the "filter" settings in your monitor definition.

image:Monitor_Group_By_Example.png[Group By example in monitor definition]

This change brings Metric Monitors and Log Monitors into feature parity by normalizing the “Group By” aspect of Monitor Definitions. This parity will allow customers to clone/duplicate *all* system-defined default Monitors for further customization.

==== Duplicating
You can now clone (duplicate) the Change Log, Kubernetes Log, and Data Collector Log monitors. This creates a new custom log monitor that you can modify to your specific definitions.

=== Autocomplete Suggestions, Wildcards, and Expressions in Filters

With this release of Cloud Insights, you no longer need to know all the possible names and values on which to filter in a query or widget. When filtering, you can simply start typing and Cloud insights will suggest values based on your text. No more looking up Application names or Kubernetes attributes ahead of time just to find the ones you want to show in your widget.

As you type in a filter, the filter displays a smart list of results from which you can choose, as well as the option to create a *wildcard filter* based on the current text. Selecting this option will return all results that match the wildcard expression. You can of course also select multiple individual values that you want added to the filter.

image:Type-Ahead-Example-ingest.png[Wildcard Filter]

Note that this only affects the column's display name in the table widget; the metric/attribute name does not change in the underlying data itself.

image:Table_Widget_Column_Rename.png[Table Widget Rename Column]

'''

== October 2020

=== Default Expansion of Integration Data

Table widget grouping now allows for default expansions of Kubernetes, ONTAP Advanced Data, and Agent Node metrics. For example, if you group Kubernetes _Nodes_ by _Cluster_, you will see a row in the table for each cluster. You could then expand each cluster row to see a list of the Node objects.


//CIS-10642

=== Basic Edition Technical Support

Technical Support is now available for subscribers to Cloud Insights Basic Edition in addition to Standard and Premium Editions. Additionally, Cloud Insights has simplified the workflow for creating a NetApp support ticket.


=== Cloud Secure Public API

Cloud Secure supports link:concept_cs_api.html[REST APIs] for accessing Activity and Alert information. This is accomplished through the use of API Access Tokens, created through the Cloud Secure Admin UI, which are then used to access the REST APIs. Swagger documentation for these REST APIs is integrated with Cloud Secure.

'''

=== Subscribe to Premium Edition through AWS

During your trial of Cloud Insights, you can link:concept_subscribing_to_cloud_insights.html[self-subscribe] through AWS Marketplace to either Cloud Insights Standard Edition or Premium Edition. Previously, you could only self-subscribe through AWS Marketplace to Standard Edition only.  

=== Enhanced Table Widget

The dashboard/asset page Table widget includes the following enhancements:

* "Split-Screen" view: Table widgets display the object/grouping on the left side, and the object data (attributes/metrics) on the right.
+
image:TableWidgetLeftRightPanes.png[Table Widget showing left and right panes]

* Multiple attribute grouping: For Integration data (Kubernetes, ONTAP Advanced Metrics, Docker, etc.), you can choose multiple attributes for grouping. Data is displayed according to the grouping attributes/you choose. 
+
Grouping with Integration Data (shown in Edit mode):
image:TableWidgetIntegrationEditMode.png[Integration Data Grouping in Table Widget]

* Grouping for Infrastructure data (storage, EC2, VM, ports, etc.) is by a single attribute as before. When grouping by an attribute which is not the object, the table will allow you to expand the group row to see all the objects within the group.
+
Grouping with Infrastructure data (shown in display mode):
image:TableWidgetPerformanceData.png[Infrastructure Data Grouping in Table Widget]

=== Metrics Filtering

In addition to filtering on an object's attributes in a widget, you can now filter on metrics as well. 

image:MetricsFiltering.png[Metrics Filtering]

//When working with integration data (Kubernetes, ONTAP Advanced Data, etc.), metric filtering works against the data samples themselves, not the objects as with infrastructure data (storage, VMs, ports, etc.).

When working with integration data (Kubernetes, ONTAP Advanced Data, etc.), metric filtering removes the individual/unmatched data points from the plotted data series, unlike infrastructure data (storage, VM, ports etc.) where filters work on the aggregated value of the data series and potentially remove the entire object from the chart.

image:IntegrationMetricFilterExample.png[Integration Metric Filtering]

=== ONTAP Advanced Counter Data

Cloud Insights takes advantage of NetApp's ONTAP-specific *Advanced Counter Data*, which provides a host of counters and metrics collected from ONTAP devices.  ONTAP Advanced Counter Data is available to all NetApp ONTAP customers. These metrics enable customized and wide-ranging visualization in Cloud Insights widgets and dashboards.

ONTAP Advanced Counters can be found by searching for "netapp_ontap" in the widget's query, and selecting from among the counters.

image:netapp_ontap counters.png[Searching for ONTAP Advanced Counters]

You can refine your search by typing additional parts of the counter name. For example:

* _lif_
* _aggregate_
* _offbox_vscan_server_
* and more

image:ONTAP_Widget_Example2.png[ONTAP Widget Example - WAFL]
image:ONTAP_Widget_Example1.png[ONTAP Widget Example - Cp Reads]

Please note the following:

* Advanced Data collection will be enabled by default for new ONTAP data collectors. To enable Advanced Data collection for your existing ONTAP data collectors, edit the data collector and expand the _Advanced Configuration_ section.

* Advanced Data collection is not available for 7-mode ONTAP.

=== Advanced Counter Dashboards

Cloud Insights comes with a variety of pre-designed dashboards to help get you started on visualizing ONTAP Advanced Counters for topics such as _Aggregate Performance_, _Volume Workload_, _Processor Activity_, and more. If you have at least one ONTAP data collector configured, these can be imported from the Dashboard Gallery on any dashboard list page.

=== Learn More

More information on ONTAP Advanced Data can be found at the following links:

* https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/tools/tool-eula/netapp-harvest (Note: You will need to sign in to NetApp Support)

* https://nabox.org/faq/ 


////
=== Advanced Data Polling

Be aware that ONTAP Advanced Data is polled at a more rapid rate than polling for traditional inventory and performance data, with the result that the Cloud Insights Data Collector list page may appear to show ONTAP devices in a state of near-constant polling. This is expected and does not indicate a problem in the Acquisition Unit, Cloud Insights, or the monitored cluster.

image:ontap_advanced_polling.png[ONTAP Advanced Data polling]
////


=== Policies and Violations Menu

Performance Policies and Violations are now found under the *Alerts* menu. Policy and Violation functionality are unchanged.

image:PoliciesMenuChange.png[Policies and Violations Menu]


=== Updated Telegraf Agent

The agent for ingestion of telegraf integration data has been updated to link:https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.14/[version 1.14], which includes bugs fixes, security fixes, and new plugins.

Note: When configuring a Kubernetes data collector on the Kubernetes platform, you may see an "HTTP status 403 Forbidden" error in the log, due to insufficient permissions in the "clusterrole" attribute.

To work around this issue, add the following highlighted lines to the _rules:_ section of the endpoint-access clusterrole, and then restart the Telegraf pods. 

--------------------------
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""

== June 2020

=== Simplified Data Collector Error Reporting

Reporting a data collector error is easier with the _Send Error Report_ button on the data collector page. Clicking the button sends basic information about the error to NetApp and prompts investigation into the problem. Once pressed, Cloud Insights acknowledges that NetApp has been notified, and the Error Report button is disabled to indicate that an error report for that data collector has been sent. The button remains disabled until the browser page is refreshed.

image:DCErrorReportButton.png[Error Report Button]

=== Widget Improvements

The following improvements have been made in dashboard widgets. These improvements are considered Preview functionality and may not be available for all Cloud Insights environments.

* New object/metric chooser: Objects (Storage, Disk, Ports, Nodes, etc.) and their associated metrics (IOPS, Latency, CPU Count, etc.) are now available in widgets in a single inclusive drop-down with powerful search capability. You can enter multiple partial terms in the drop-down, and Cloud Insights will list all object metrics meeting those terms.

image:Object_Metric_Chooser.png[Object/Metric Chooser]

* Multiple tags grouping: When working with integration data (Kubernetes, etc.), you may group the data by multiple tags/attributes. For example, Sum memory usage by Kubernetes Namespace and Container name.

image:MultipleGroupsIntegrationLineChart.png[Multiple grouping when displaying integration data]

'''

* Entities view, focused on what files the user accessed. 

image:CSActivityForensicsExample.png[Entities Page Example]

Additionally, the Alert email notification now contains a direct link to the alert page.

=== Dashboard Grouping

Dashboard grouping allows better link:concept_dashboard_features.html#dashboard-groups[ management of dashboards] that are relevant to you. You can add related dashboards to a group for "one-stop" management of, for example, your storage or virtual machines. 

Groups are customized per user, so one person's groups can be different from someone else's. You can have as many groups as you need, with as few or as many dashboards in each group as you like.

image:DashboardGroupNoPin.png[Dashboard Groups]

=== Dashboard Pinning

You can pin dashboards so favorites always appear at the top of the list. 

image:DashboardPin.png[Dashboard Pins]

=== TV Mode and Auto-Refresh

link:concept_dashboard_features.html#tv-mode-and-auto-refresh[TV Mode and Auto-Refresh] allow for near-real-time display of data on a dashboard or asset page:

* *TV Mode* provides an uncluttered display; the navigation menu is hidden, providing more screen real estate for your data display. 

* Data in widgets on Dashboards and Asset Landing Pages *Auto-Refresh* according a refresh interval (as little as every 10 seconds) determined by the Dashboard Time Range selected (or widget time range, if set to override the dashboard time). 

Combined, TV Mode and Auto-Refresh provide a live view of your Cloud Insights data, perfect for seamless demonstrations or in-house monitoring.

'''

== April 2020

=== New Dashboard Time Range Choices

Time range choices for dashboards and other Cloud insights pages now include _Last 1 Hour_ and _Last 15 Minutes_.

=== Cloud Secure Updates

Cloud Insights includes the following recent Cloud Secure changes.

*	Better file and folder metadata change recognition to detect if the user changed Permission, Owner, or Group Ownership.

* Export user activity report to CSV.

Cloud Secure monitors and audits all user access operations on files and folders. Activity auditing allows you to comply with internal security policies, meet external compliance requirements such as PCI, GDPR, and HIPAA, and conduct data breach and security incident investigations.


=== Default Dashboard Time

The default time range for dashboards is now 3 Hours instead of 24 hours. 

=== Optimized Aggregation Times

Optimized link:concept_dashboard_features.html#aggregating-data[time aggregation] intervals in time-series widgets (Line, Spline, Area, and Stacked Area charts) are more frequent for 3-hour and 24-hour dashboard/widget time ranges, allowing for faster charting of data. 

* 3 hour time range optimizes to a 1 minute aggregation interval. Previously this was 5 minutes.
* 24 hour time range optimizes to a 30 minute aggregation interval. Previously this was 1 hour.

You can still override the optimized aggregation by setting a custom interval.


=== Display Unit Auto-Format

In most widgets, Cloud Insights knows the base unit in which to display values, for example _Megabytes_, _Thousands_, _Percentage_, _Milliseconds (ms)_, etc., and now link:concept_dashboard_features.html#choosing-the-unit-for-displaying-data[automatically formats] the widget to the most readable unit. For example a data value of 1,234,567,890 bytes would be auto formatted to 1.23 gibibytes. In many cases, Cloud Insights knows the best format for the data being acquired. In cases where the best format is not known, or in widgets where you want to override the automatic formatting, you can choose the format you want.

image:used_memory_in_bytes_gb.png[Auto Format in Widgets,width=480]


=== Import Annotations Using API

With Cloud Insights Premium Edition's powerful API, you can now link:task_annotation_import.html[import annotations] and assign them to objects using a .CSV file. You can also import applications and assign business entities in the same way.

image:api_assets_import.png[Importing Annotations]



=== Simpler Widget Selector

Adding widgets to dashboards and asset landing pages is easier with a new widget selector that shows all widget types in a single all-at-once view, so the user no longer needs to scroll through a list of widget types to find the one they want to add. Related widgets are color-coordinated and grouped by proximity in the new selector.

image:NewWidgetPicker.png[New widget selector]

'''

== February 2020

=== API with Premium Edition

Cloud Insights Premium Edition comes with a link:API_Overview.html[powerful API] that can be used to integrate Cloud Insights with other applications, such as CMDB’s or other ticketing systems. 

Detailed, Swagger-based information is found in *Admin > API Acccess*, under the *API Documentation* link. Swagger provides a brief description and usage information for the API, and allows you to try each API out in your environment.

The Cloud Insights API uses Access Tokens to provide permission-based access to categories of API, such as ASSETS or COLLECTION. 

image:API_Documentation.png[API Documentation] 


=== Initial Polling After Adding A Data Collector

Previously, after configuring a new data collector, Cloud Insights would poll the data collector immediately to gather _inventory_ data, but would wait until the configured performance poll interval (typically 15 minutes) to gather initial _performance_ data. It would then wait for another interval before initiating the second performance poll, which meant it would take up to _30 minutes_ before meaningful data was acquired from a new data collector.

Data collector link:task_configure_data_collectors.html[polling] has been greatly improved, such that the initial performance poll occurs immediately after the inventory poll, with the second performance poll occurring within a few seconds after completion of the first performance poll. This allows Cloud Insights to begin showing useful data on dashboards and graphs within a very short time.

This poll behavior also occurs after editing the configuration of an existing data collector.


=== Easier Widget Duplication 

It is easier than ever to create a copy of a widget on a dashboard or landing page. In dashboard Edit mode, click the menu on the widget and select *Duplicate*. The widget editor is launched, pre-filled with the original widget's configuration and with a “copy” suffix in the widget name. You can easily make any necessary changes and Save the new widget. The widget will be placed at the bottom of your dashboard, and you can position it as needed. Remember to Save your dashboard when all changes are complete.

image:DuplicateWidget.png[Duplicate a widget]


=== Single Sign-On (SSO)

With Cloud Insights Premium Edition, administrators can enable *link:concept_user_roles.html#what-is-identity-federation[Single Sign-On]* (SSO) access to Cloud Insights for all users in their corporate domain, without having to invite them individually. With SSO enabled, any user with the same domain email address can log into Cloud Insights using their corporate credentials.

NOTE: SSO is only available in Cloud Insights Premium Edition, and must be configured before it can be enabled for Cloud Insights. SSO configuration includes link:https://services.cloud.netapp.com/misc/federation-support[Identity Federation] through NetApp Cloud Central. Federation allows single sign-on users to access your NetApp Cloud Central accounts using credentials from your corporate directory.


'''

== January 2020

=== Swagger documentation for REST API

=== Feature Tutorials Progress Bar

The feature tutorials checklist has been moved to the top banner and now features a progress indicator. Tutorials are available for each user until dismissed, and are always available in Cloud Insights link:concept_feature_tutorials.html[documentation].

image:TutorialProgress.png[Tutorial Checklist Progress]

=== Acquisition Unit Changes

When installing an Acquisition Unit (AU) on a host or VM that has the same name as an already-installed AU, Cloud Insights assures a unique name by appending the AU name with "_1", "_2", etc. This is also the case when uninstalling and reinstalling an AU from the same VM without first removing it from Cloud Insights. Want a different AU name altogether? No problem; AU's can be renamed after installation.

=== Optimized Time Aggregation in Widgets
 
In widgets, you can choose between an _Optimized_ time aggregation interval or a _Custom_ interval that you set. Optimized aggregation automatically selects the right time interval based on the selected dashboard time range (or widget time range, if overriding the dashboard time). The interval dynamically changes as the dashboard or widget time range is changed.

=== Simplified "Getting Started with Cloud Insights" process

The process for getting started using Cloud Insights has been simplified to make your first-time setup smoother and easier. Simply select an initial data collector and follow the instructions. Cloud Insights will walk you through configuring the data collector and any agent or acquisition unit required. In most cases it will even import one or more initial dashboards so you can start gaining insight into your environment quickly (but please allow up to 30 minutes for Cloud Insights to collect meaningful data).

Additional improvements:

* Acquisition Unit installation is simpler and runs faster.

* Alphabetical Data Collectors choices make it easier to find the one you’re looking for.

* Improved Data Collector setup instructions are easier to follow.

* Experienced users can skip the getting started process with the click of a button.

* A new Progress bar shows you where you are in the process.

=== Dashboard Improvements

Dashboards and Widgets have been improved with the following changes:

* In addition to Sum, Min, Max, and Avg, *Count* is now an option for roll up in Single-Value widgets. When rolling up by “Count”, Cloud Insights checks if an object is active or not, and only adds the active ones to the count. The resulting number is subject to aggregation and filters. 

* In the Single-Value widget, you now have a choice to display the resulting number with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 decimal places.

* Line charts show an axis label and units when a single counter is being plotted. 

* *Transform* option is available for Services integration data now in all time-series widgets for all metrics. For any services integration (Telegraf) counter or metric in time-series widgets (Line, Spline, Area, Stacked Area), you are given a choice of how you want to link:concept_telegraf_display_options.html[Transform the values]. None (display value as-is), Sum, Delta, Cumulative, etc.
