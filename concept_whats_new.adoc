[lead]
NetApp is continually improving and enhancing its products and services. Here are some of the latest features and functionalities available with Cloud Insights.

=== January 2020

==== Simplified "Getting Started with Cloud Insights" process

The process for getting started using Cloud Insights has been simplified to make your first-time setup smoother and easier. Simply select an initial data collector and follow the instructions. Cloud Insights will walk you through configuring the data collector and any agent or acquisition unit required. In most cases it will even import one or more initial dashboards so you can start gaining insight into your environment quickly (but please allow up to 30 minutes for Cloud Insights to collect meaningful data).

Additional improvements:

* Acquisition Unit installation is simpler and runs faster.

* Alphabetical Data Collectors choices make it easier to find the one you’re looking for.

* Improved Data Collector setup instructions are easier to follow.

* Experienced users can skip the getting started process with the click of a button.

* A new Progress bar shows you where you are in the process.

=== December 2019

==== Business Entity can be used in filters

Business Entity annotations can be used in filters for queries, widgets, performance policies, and landing pages.

==== Drill-down available for Single-Value and Gauge widgets, and any widgets rolled to by "All"

Clicking the value in a single-value or gauge widget opens a query page showing the results of the first query used in the widget. Additionally, clicking the legend for any widget whose data is rolled up by "All" will also open a query page showing the results of the first query used in the widget.

==== Trial period extended

New users who sign up for a free trial of Cloud Insights now have 30 days to evaluate the product. This is an increase from the previous 14-day trial period.

==== Managed Unit calculation

The calculation of Managed Units (MUs) in Cloud Insights has been changed to the following:

* 1 Managed Unit = 2 hosts (any virtual or physical machine)
* 1 Managed Unit = 4 TB of unformatted capacity of physical or virtual disks

This change effectively doubles the environment capacity that you can monitor using your existing Cloud Insights subscription.

=== November 2019

==== Single Sign-On (SSO)

In addition to inviting users, administrators can enable link:#single-sign-on-(sso)-accounts[Single Sign-On (SSO)] access to Cloud Insights for all users in their corporate domain, without having to invite them individually. With SSO enabled, any user with the same domain email address can log into Cloud Insights.

SSO is available in Cloud Insights Premium Edition, and must be configured before it can be enabled for Cloud Insights. SSO configuration includes link:https://services.cloud.netapp.com/misc/federation-support[Identity Federation] through NetApp Cloud Central. Federation allows single sign-on users to access your NetApp Cloud Central accounts using credentials from your corporate directory.

==== Invite Users During Onboarding

At any point during the onboarding process, you can click on Admin > User Management > +User to invite additional users to your Cloud Insights environment. Be aware that users with _Guest_ or _User_ roles will see greater benefit once onboarding is complete and data has been collected.

==== Data Collector Detail Page improvement

The data collector detail page has been improved to display errors in a more readable format. Errors are now displayed in a separate table on the page, with each error displayed on a separate line in the case of multiple errors for the data collector.


=== August 2019

==== All vs. Available Data Collectors

When adding data collectors to your environment, you can set a filter to show only the data collectors available to you based on your subscription level, or all data collectors. 

////

==== Business Entity Annotations

_Business Entity_ is now an annotation type provided by Cloud Insights, which can be used for monitoring and reporting of assets in your business hierarchy. An example business entity annotation might have a value of <Tenant>.<Line_of_Business>.<Business_Unit>.<Project>. An example might look like "Netapp.Cloud Services.Saas.Cloud Insights".

==== ActiveIQ Integration

Cloud Insights collects data from NetApp ActiveIQ, which provides a series of visualizations, analytics, and other support related services to NetApp customers and their hardware / software systems. Cloud Insights integrates with ONTAP Data Management systems. See link:concept_activeiq.html[Active IQ] for more information.


=== July 2019

==== Dashboard Improvements

Dashboards and Widgets have been improved with the following changes:

* In addition to Sum, Min, Max, and Avg, *Count* is now an option for roll up in Single-Value widgets. When rolling up by “Count”, Cloud Insights checks if an object is active or not, and only adds the active ones to the count. The resulting number is subject to aggregation and filters. 

* In the Single-Value widget, you now have a choice to display the resulting number with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 decimal places.

* Line charts show an axis label and units when a single counter is being plotted. 

* *Transform* option is available for Services integration data now in all time-series widgets for all metrics. For any services integration (Telegraf) counter or metric in time-series widgets (Line, Spline, Area, Stacked Area), you are given a choice of how you want to link:concept_telegraf_display_options.html[Transform the values]. None (display value as-is), Sum, Delta, Cumulative, etc. 

==== Downgrading to Basic Edition

Downgrade to Basic Edition fails with an error message if there is no available NetApp device configured that has successfully completed a poll in the last 7 days.


==== Collecting Kube-State-Metrics

The link:task_config_telegraf_kubernetes.html[Kubernetes Data Collector] now collects objects and counters from the kube-state-metrics plugin, greatly expanding the number and scope of metrics available for monitoring in Cloud Insights.

=== June 2019

==== Cloud Insights Editions

Cloud Insights is available in different Editions to fit your budget and business needs. Existing NetApp customers with an active NetApp support account can enjoy 7 days of data retention and access to NetApp data collectors with the free *Basic Edition*, or get increased data retention, access to all supported data collectors, expert technical support and more with *Standard Edition*. For more information on available features, see NetApp's link:https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-insights[Cloud Insights] site.

==== New Infrastructure Data Collector: NetApp HCI

* link:task_dc_na_hci.html[NetApp HCI Virtual Center] has been added as an Infrastructure data collector. The HCI Virtual Center data collector collects NetApp HCI Host information and requires read-only privileges on all objects within the Virtual Center.

Note that the HCI data collector acquires from the HCI Virtual Center only. To collect data from the storage system, you must also configure the NetApp link:task_dc_na_solidfire[SolidFire] data collector.


=== May 2019

==== New Service Data Collector: Kapacitor

* link:task_config_telegraf_kapacitor.html[Kapacitor] has been added as a data collector for services.

==== Integration with Services via Telegraf

In addition to acquisition of data from infrastructure devices such as switches and storage, Cloud Insights now collects data from a variety of Operating Systems and Services, using link:task_config_telegraf_agent.html[Telegraf as its agent] for collection of integration data. Telegraf is a plugin-driven agent that can be used to collect and report metrics. Input plugins are used to collect the desired information into the agent by accessing the system/OS directly, by calling third-party APIs, or by listening to configured streams. 

Documentation for currently supported integrations can be found in the menu to the left under *Services Data Collector Reference*.


==== Storage Virtual Machine Assets 

* Storage Virtual Machines (SVMs) are available as assets in Cloud Insights. SVMs have their own Asset Landing Pages, and can be displayed and used in searches, queries, and filters. SVMs can also be used in dashboard widgets as well as associated with annotations.
