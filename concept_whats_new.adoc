[lead]
NetApp is continually improving and enhancing its products and services. Here are some of the latest features and functionalities available with Cloud Insights.


=== *August 2019*

==== New Gauge Widgets

Two new widgets are available for displaying single-value data on your dashboards in eye-catching colors based on thresholds you specify. You can display values using either a *Solid Gauge* or *Bullet Gauge*. Values that land inside the Warning range are displayed in amber. Values in the Critical range are displayed in red. Values below the Warning threshold are displayed in green.

In addition, you can now display the Single-Value widget with a colored background based on Warning and Critical thresholds.

==== All vs. Available Data Collectors

When adding data collectors to your environment, you can set a filter to show only the data collectors available to you based on your subscription level, or all data collectors.

==== Business Entity Annotations

_Business Entity_ is now an annotation type provided by Cloud Insights, which can be used for monitoring and reporting of assets in your business hierarchy. An example business entity annotation might have a value of <Tenant>.<Line_of_Business>.<Business_Unit>.<Project>. An example might look like "Netapp.Cloud Services.Saas.Cloud Insights".

==== ActiveIQ Integration

Cloud Insights collects data from NetApp ActiveIQ, which provides a series of visualizations, analytics, and other support related services to NetApp customers and their hardware / software systems. Cloud Insights integrates with ONTAP Data Management systems. See link:concept_activeiq.html[Active IQ] for more information.


=== *July 2019*

==== Dashboard Improvements

Dashboards and Widgets have been improved with the following changes:

* In addition to Sum, Min, Max, and Avg, *Count* is now an option for roll up in Single-Value widgets. When rolling up by “Count”, Cloud Insights checks if an object is active or not, and only adds the active ones to the count. The resulting number is subject to aggregation and filters. 

* In the Single-Value widget, you now have a choice to display the resulting number with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 decimal places.

* Line charts show an axis label and units when a single counter is being plotted. 

* *Transform* option is available for Services integration data now in all time-series widgets for all metrics. For any services integration (Telegraf) counter or metric in time-series widgets (Line, Spline, Area, Stacked Area), you are given a choice of how you want to link:concept_telegraf_display_options.html[Transform the values]. None (display value as-is), Sum, Delta, Cumulative, etc. 

==== Downgrading to Basic Edition

Downgrade to Basic Edition fails with an error message if there is no available NetApp device configured that has successfully completed a poll in the last 7 days.


==== Collecting Kube-State-Metrics

The link:task_config_telegraf_kubernetes.html[Kubernetes Data Collector] now collects objects and counters from the kube-state-metrics plugin, greatly expanding the number and scope of metrics available for monitoring in Cloud Insights.

=== *June 2019*

==== Cloud Insights Editions

Cloud Insights is available in different Editions to fit your budget and business needs. Existing NetApp customers with an active NetApp support account can enjoy 7 days of data retention and access to NetApp data collectors with the free *Basic Edition*, or get increased data retention, access to all supported data collectors, expert technical support and more with *Standard Edition*. For more information on available features, see NetApp's link:https://cloud.netapp.com/cloud-insights[Cloud Insights] site.

==== New Infrastructure Data Collector: NetApp HCI

* link:task_dc_na_hci.html[NetApp HCI Virtual Center] has been added as an Infrastructure data collector. The HCI Virtual Center data collector collects NetApp HCI Host information and requires read-only privileges on all objects within the Virtual Center.

Note that the HCI data collector acquires from the HCI Virtual Center only. To collect data from the storage system, you must also configure the NetApp link:task_dc_na_solidfire[SolidFire] data collector.


=== *May 2019*

==== New Service Data Collector: Kapacitor

* link:task_config_telegraf_kapacitor.html[Kapacitor] has been added as a data collector for services.

==== Integration with Services via Telegraf

In addition to acquisition of data from infrastructure devices such as switches and storage, Cloud Insights now collects data from a variety of Operating Systems and Services, using link:task_config_telegraf_agent.html[Telegraf as its agent] for collection of integration data. Telegraf is a plugin-driven agent that can be used to collect and report metrics. Input plugins are used to collect the desired information into the agent by accessing the system/OS directly, by calling third-party APIs, or by listening to configured streams. 

Documentation for currently supported integrations can be found in the menu to the left under *Services Data Collector Reference*.


==== Storage Virtual Machine Assets 

* Storage Virtual Machines (SVMs) are available as assets in Cloud Insights. SVMs have their own Asset Landing Pages, and can be displayed and used in searches, queries, and filters. SVMs can also be used in dashboard widgets as well as associated with annotations.

==== Reduced Acquisition Unit System Requirements

* The system CPU and memory requirements for the Acquisition Unit (AU) software have been reduced. The new requirements are:

|===
|*Component*|*Old Requirement*|*New Requirement*

=== *February 2019*

==== Collecting from AWS Child Accounts

* Cloud Insights supports link:task_dc_amazon_ec2.html#collecting_from_aws_child_accounts[collection from AWS child accounts] within a single data collector. Your AWS environment must be configured to allow Cloud Insights to collect from child accounts.

==== Data Collector Naming 

* Data Collector names can now include periods (.), hyphens (-), and spaces ( ) in addition to letters, numbers, and underscores. Names may not begin or end with a space, period, or hyphen.


==== Acquisition Unit for Windows

* You can configure a Cloud Insights Acquisition Unit on a Windows server/VM. Review the Windows link:concept_acquisition_unit_requirements.html[pre-requisites] before installing the link:task_configure_acquisition_unit.html[Acquisition Unit software].


=== *January 2019*

==== "Owner" field is more readable

* In Dashboard and Query lists, the data for the "Owner" field was previously an authorization ID string, instead of a user-friendly owner name. The "Owner" field now shows a simpler and more readable owner name.

==== Managed Unit Breakdown on Subscription Page

* For each data collector listed on the *Admin > Subscription* page, you can now see a breakdown of Managed Unit (MU) counts for hosts and storage, as well as the total.


=== *December 2018*

==== Improvement of UI Load Time

* The initial loading time for the Cloud Insights user interface (UI) has been significantly improved. Refresh time for the UI also benefits from this improvement in circumstances where metadata is loaded.

==== Bulk Edit Data Collectors

* You can edit information for multiple data collectors at the same time. On the *Admin > Data Collectors* page, select the data collectors to modify by checking the box to the left of each and click the *Bulk Actions* button. Choose *Edit* and modify the necessary fields.

A new *Contact Sales* link is presented on the *Admin > Subscription* page. For customers whose environments have or are expected to have 1,000 or more Managed Units (MUs), it is recommended to contact NetApp sales via the Contact Sales link.

==== Text Annotation Hyperlinks

* Text-type annotations can now include hyperlinks. 

==== Onboarding Walkthrough

* Cloud Insights now features an onboarding walkthrough for the first user (administrator or account owner) to log in to a new environment. The walkthrough takes you through installing an Acquisition Unit, configuring an initial data collector, and selecting one or more useful dashboards.

==== Import Dashboards from the Gallery

* In addition to selecting dashboards during onboarding, you can import dashboards via *Dashboards > Show All Dashboards* and clicking *+From Gallery*.

==== Duplicating Dashboards
