[lead]
NetApp is continually improving and enhancing its products and services. Here are some of the latest features and functionalities available with Cloud Insights.

=== July 2020

==== Updated Telegraf Agent

The agent for ingestion of telegraf integration data has been updated to link:https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.14/[version 1.14].

NOTE: Due to enhanced security in the newer Telegraf version, you may see an "HTTP status 403 Forbidden" error in the log when attempting to configure a Kubernetes data collector on the Kubernetes platform. This is due to insufficient permissions in the "clusterrole" attribute.

To work around this issue, add the following lines to the "rules > resources" section of the telegraf configuration file:

rules:
- apiGroups:
  - ""
  - apps
  - autoscaling
  - batch
  - extensions
  - policy
  - rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  attributeRestrictions: null
  resources:
  - nodes/metrics
  - *nodes/proxy*
  - nodes/stats
  - *pods*
  verbs:
  - get
  - *list*



=== June 2020

==== Widget Improvements

The following improvements have been made in dashboard widgets. These improvements are considered Preview functionality and may not be available for all Cloud Insights environments.

* New object/metric chooser: Objects (Storage, Disk, Ports, Nodes, etc.) and their associated metrics (IOPS, Latency, CPU Count, etc.) are now available in widgets in a single inclusive drop-down with powerful search capability. You can enter multiple partial terms in the drop-down, and Cloud Insights will list all object metrics meeting those terms.

image:Object_Metric_Chooser.png[Object/Metric Chooser]

* Multiple tags grouping: When working with integration data (Kubernetes, etc.), you may group the data by multiple tags/attributes. For example, Sum memory usage by Kubernetes Namespace and Container name.

image:MultipleGroupsIntegrationLineChart.png[Multiple grouping when displaying integration data]



=== May 2020

==== Reporting User Roles

The following roles have been added for Reporting:

* Cloud Insights Consumers: can run and view reports
* Cloud Insights Authors: can perform the Consumer functions as well as create and manage reports and dashboards
* Cloud Insights Administrators: can perform the Author functions as well as all administrative tasks


==== Cloud Secure Updates

Cloud Insights includes the following recent Cloud Secure changes.

In the Forensics > Activity Forensics page, we provide two views to analyze and investigate user activity:

* Activity view, focused on user activity (What operation? Where performed?)
* Entities view, focused on what files the user accessed. 

image:CSActivityForensicsExample.png[Entities Page Example]

Additionally, the Alert email notification now contains a direct link to the alert page.

==== Dashboard Grouping

Dashboard grouping allows better link:concept_dashboard_features.html#dashboard-groups[ management of dashboards] that are relevant to you. You can add related dashboards to a group for "one-stop" management of, for example, your storage or virtual machines. 

Groups are customized per user, so one person's groups can be different from someone else's. You can have as many groups as you need, with as few or as many dashboards in each group as you like.

image:DashboardGroupNoPin.png[Dashboard Groups]

==== Dashboard Pinning

You can pin dashboards so favorites always appear at the top of the list. 

image:DashboardPin.png[Dashboard Pins]

==== TV Mode and Auto-Refresh

link:concept_dashboard_features.html#tv-mode-and-auto-refresh[TV Mode and Auto-Refresh] allow for near-real-time display of data on a dashboard or asset page:

* *TV Mode* provides an uncluttered display; the navigation menu is hidden, providing more screen real estate for your data display. 

* Data in widgets on Dashboards and Asset Landing Pages *Auto-Refresh* according a refresh interval (as little as every 10 seconds) determined by the Dashboard Time Range selected (or widget time range, if set to override the dashboard time). 

Combined, TV Mode and Auto-Refresh provide a live view of your Cloud Insights data, perfect for seamless demonstrations or in-house monitoring.

=== April 2020

==== New Dashboard Time Range Choices

Time range choices for dashboards and other Cloud insights pages now include _Last 1 Hour_ and _Last 15 Minutes_.

==== Cloud Secure Updates

Cloud Insights includes the following recent Cloud Secure changes.

*	Better file and folder metadata change recognition to detect if the user changed Permission, Owner, or Group Ownership.

* Export user activity report to CSV.

Cloud Secure monitors and audits all user access operations on files and folders. Activity auditing allows you to comply with internal security policies, meet external compliance requirements such as PCI, GDPR, and HIPAA, and conduct data breach and security incident investigations.


==== Default Dashboard Time

The default time range for dashboards is now 3 Hours instead of 24 hours. 

==== Optimized Aggregation Times

Optimized link:concept_dashboard_features.html#aggregating-data[time aggregation] intervals in time-series widgets (Line, Spline, Area, and Stacked Area charts) are more frequent for 3-hour and 24-hour dashboard/widget time ranges, allowing for faster charting of data. 

* 3 hour time range optimizes to a 1 minute aggregation interval. Previously this was 5 minutes.
* 24 hour time range optimizes to a 30 minute aggregation interval. Previously this was 1 hour.

You can still override the optimized aggregation by setting a custom interval.


==== Display Unit Auto-Format

In most widgets, Cloud Insights knows the base unit in which to display values, for example _Megabytes_, _Thousands_, _Percentage_, _Milliseconds (ms)_, etc., and now link:concept_dashboard_features.html#choosing-the-unit-for-displaying-data[automatically formats] the widget to the most readable unit. For example, a data value of 1,234,567,890 bytes would be auto formatted to 1.23bn (billion). In many cases, Cloud Insights knows the best format for the data being acquired. In cases where the best format is not known, or in widgets where you want to override the automatic formatting, you can choose the format you want.

image:used_memory_in_bytes_gb.png[Auto Format in Widgets,width=480]


==== Import Annotations Using API

With Cloud Insights Premium Edition's powerful API, you can now link:task_annotation_import.html[import annotations] and assign them to objects using a .CSV file. You can also import applications and assign business entities in the same way.

image:api_assets_import.png[Importing Annotations]



==== Simpler Widget Selector

Adding widgets to dashboards and asset landing pages is easier with a new widget selector that shows all widget types in a single all-at-once view, so the user no longer needs to scroll through a list of widget types to find the one they want to add. Related widgets are color-coordinated and grouped by proximity in the new selector.

image:NewWidgetPicker.png[New widget selector]


=== February 2020

==== API with Premium Edition

Cloud Insights Premium Edition comes with a link:API_Overview.html[powerful API] that can be used to integrate Cloud Insights with other applications, such as CMDB’s or other ticketing systems. 

Detailed, Swagger-based information is found in *Admin > API Acccess*, under the *API Documentation* link. Swagger provides a brief description and usage information for the API, and allows you to try each API out in your environment.

The Cloud Insights API uses Access Tokens to provide permission-based access to categories of API, such as ASSETS or COLLECTION. 

image:API_Documentation.png[API Documentation] 


==== Initial Polling After Adding A Data Collector

Previously, after configuring a new data collector, Cloud Insights would poll the data collector immediately to gather _inventory_ data, but would wait until the configured performance poll interval (typically 15 minutes) to gather initial _performance_ data. It would then wait for another interval before initiating the second performance poll, which meant it would take up to _30 minutes_ before meaningful data was acquired from a new data collector.

Data collector link:task_configure_data_collectors.html[polling] has been greatly improved, such that the initial performance poll occurs immediately after the inventory poll, with the second performance poll occurring within a few seconds after completion of the first performance poll. This allows Cloud Insights to begin showing useful data on dashboards and graphs within a very short time.

This poll behavior also occurs after editing the configuration of an existing data collector.


==== Easier Widget Duplication 

It is easier than ever to create a copy of a widget on a dashboard or landing page. In dashboard Edit mode, click the menu on the widget and select *Duplicate*. The widget editor is launched, pre-filled with the original widget's configuration and with a “copy” suffix in the widget name. You can easily make any necessary changes and Save the new widget. The widget will be placed at the bottom of your dashboard, and you can position it as needed. Remember to Save your dashboard when all changes are complete.

image:DuplicateWidget.png[Duplicate a widget]


==== Single Sign-On (SSO)

With Cloud Insights Premium Edition, administrators can enable *link:concept_user_roles.html#single-sign-on-sso-accounts[Single Sign-On]* (SSO) access to Cloud Insights for all users in their corporate domain, without having to invite them individually. With SSO enabled, any user with the same domain email address can log into Cloud Insights using their corporate credentials.

NOTE: SSO is only available in Cloud Insights Premium Edition, and must be configured before it can be enabled for Cloud Insights. SSO configuration includes link:https://services.cloud.netapp.com/misc/federation-support[Identity Federation] through NetApp Cloud Central. Federation allows single sign-on users to access your NetApp Cloud Central accounts using credentials from your corporate directory.

=== January 2020

==== Swagger documentation for REST API

Swagger explains each available REST API in Cloud Insights, as well as its usage and syntax. Information on Cloud Insights APIs is available in link:http://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/API_Overview.html[documentation].

==== Feature Tutorials Progress Bar

The feature tutorials checklist has been moved to the top banner and now features a progress indicator. Tutorials are available for each user until dismissed, and are always available in Cloud Insights link:concept_feature_tutorials.html[documentation].

image:TutorialProgress.png[Tutorial Checklist Progress]

==== Acquisition Unit Changes

When installing an Acquisition Unit (AU) on a host or VM that has the same name as an already-installed AU, Cloud Insights assures a unique name by appending the AU name with "_1", "_2", etc. This is also the case when uninstalling and reinstalling an AU from the same VM without first removing it from Cloud Insights. Want a different AU name altogether? No problem; AU's can be renamed after installation.

==== Optimized Time Aggregation in Widgets
 
In widgets, you can choose between an _Optimized_ time aggregation interval or a _Custom_ interval that you set. Optimized aggregation automatically selects the right time interval based on the selected dashboard time range (or widget time range, if overriding the dashboard time). The interval dynamically changes as the dashboard or widget time range is changed.

==== Simplified "Getting Started with Cloud Insights" process

The process for getting started using Cloud Insights has been simplified to make your first-time setup smoother and easier. Simply select an initial data collector and follow the instructions. Cloud Insights will walk you through configuring the data collector and any agent or acquisition unit required. In most cases it will even import one or more initial dashboards so you can start gaining insight into your environment quickly (but please allow up to 30 minutes for Cloud Insights to collect meaningful data).

Additional improvements:

* Acquisition Unit installation is simpler and runs faster.

* Alphabetical Data Collectors choices make it easier to find the one you’re looking for.

* Improved Data Collector setup instructions are easier to follow.

* Experienced users can skip the getting started process with the click of a button.

* A new Progress bar shows you where you are in the process.

=== December 2019

==== Business Entity can be used in filters

Business Entity annotations can be used in filters for queries, widgets, performance policies, and landing pages.

==== Drill-down available for Single-Value and Gauge widgets, and any widgets rolled to by "All"

Clicking the value in a single-value or gauge widget opens a query page showing the results of the first query used in the widget. Additionally, clicking the legend for any widget whose data is rolled up by "All" will also open a query page showing the results of the first query used in the widget.

==== Trial period extended

New users who sign up for a free trial of Cloud Insights now have 30 days to evaluate the product. This is an increase from the previous 14-day trial period.

==== Managed Unit calculation

The calculation of Managed Units (MUs) in Cloud Insights has been changed to the following:

* 1 Managed Unit = 2 hosts (any virtual or physical machine)
* 1 Managed Unit = 4 TB of unformatted capacity of physical or virtual disks

This change effectively doubles the environment capacity that you can monitor using your existing Cloud Insights subscription.

=== November 2019

==== Data Collector Detail Page improvement

The data collector detail page has been improved to display errors in a more readable format. Errors are now displayed in a separate table on the page, with each error displayed on a separate line in the case of multiple errors for the data collector.


=== August 2019

==== All vs. Available Data Collectors

When adding data collectors to your environment, you can set a filter to show only the data collectors available to you based on your subscription level, or all data collectors. 

////

==== Business Entity Annotations

_Business Entity_ is now an annotation type provided by Cloud Insights, which can be used for monitoring and reporting of assets in your business hierarchy. An example business entity annotation might have a value of <Tenant>.<Line_of_Business>.<Business_Unit>.<Project>. An example might look like "Netapp.Cloud Services.Saas.Cloud Insights".

==== ActiveIQ Integration

Cloud Insights collects data from NetApp ActiveIQ, which provides a series of visualizations, analytics, and other support related services to NetApp customers and their hardware / software systems. Cloud Insights integrates with ONTAP Data Management systems. See link:concept_activeiq.html[Active IQ] for more information.


=== July 2019

==== Dashboard Improvements

Dashboards and Widgets have been improved with the following changes:

* In addition to Sum, Min, Max, and Avg, *Count* is now an option for roll up in Single-Value widgets. When rolling up by “Count”, Cloud Insights checks if an object is active or not, and only adds the active ones to the count. The resulting number is subject to aggregation and filters. 

* In the Single-Value widget, you now have a choice to display the resulting number with 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 decimal places.

* Line charts show an axis label and units when a single counter is being plotted. 

* *Transform* option is available for Services integration data now in all time-series widgets for all metrics. For any services integration (Telegraf) counter or metric in time-series widgets (Line, Spline, Area, Stacked Area), you are given a choice of how you want to link:concept_telegraf_display_options.html[Transform the values]. None (display value as-is), Sum, Delta, Cumulative, etc. 

==== Downgrading to Basic Edition

Downgrade to Basic Edition fails with an error message if there is no available NetApp device configured that has successfully completed a poll in the last 7 days.


==== Collecting Kube-State-Metrics

The link:task_config_telegraf_kubernetes.html[Kubernetes Data Collector] now collects objects and counters from the kube-state-metrics plugin, greatly expanding the number and scope of metrics available for monitoring in Cloud Insights.

=== June 2019

==== New Infrastructure Data Collector: NetApp HCI

* link:task_dc_na_hci.html[NetApp HCI Virtual Center] has been added as an Infrastructure data collector. The HCI Virtual Center data collector collects NetApp HCI Host information and requires read-only privileges on all objects within the Virtual Center.

Note that the HCI data collector acquires from the HCI Virtual Center only. To collect data from the storage system, you must also configure the NetApp link:task_dc_na_solidfire[SolidFire] data collector.


=== May 2019

==== New Service Data Collector: Kapacitor

* link:task_config_telegraf_kapacitor.html[Kapacitor] has been added as a data collector for services.

==== Integration with Services via Telegraf

In addition to acquisition of data from infrastructure devices such as switches and storage, Cloud Insights now collects data from a variety of Operating Systems and Services, using link:task_config_telegraf_agent.html[Telegraf as its agent] for collection of integration data. Telegraf is a plugin-driven agent that can be used to collect and report metrics. Input plugins are used to collect the desired information into the agent by accessing the system/OS directly, by calling third-party APIs, or by listening to configured streams. 

Documentation for currently supported integrations can be found in the menu to the left under *Reference and Support*.


==== Storage Virtual Machine Assets 

* Storage Virtual Machines (SVMs) are available as assets in Cloud Insights. SVMs have their own Asset Landing Pages, and can be displayed and used in searches, queries, and filters. SVMs can also be used in dashboard widgets as well as associated with annotations.
