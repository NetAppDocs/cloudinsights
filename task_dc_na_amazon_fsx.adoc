This data collector acquires inventory and performance data from Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP. This data collector will be made available incrementally throughout the Cloud Insights service regions. Contact your sales person if you do not see the Icon for this collector in your Cloud Insights Environment.

== Terminology

Cloud Insights acquires inventory and performance data from the FSx-NetApp data collector. For each asset type acquired, the most common terminology used for the asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Vendor/Model Term | Cloud Insights Term
|Cluster|Storage
|LUN|Volume
|Volume|Internal Volume
|===

== FSx-NetApp Terminology

The following terms apply to objects or references that you might find on FSx-NetApp storage asset landing pages. Many of these terms apply to other data collectors as well.

=== Storage

* Model – A comma-delimited list of the unique, discrete model names within this cluster. 
* Vendor – AWS
* Serial number – The array serial number. 
* IP – generally will be the IP(s) or hostname(s) as configured in the data source.
//* Microcode version – firmware.
* Raw Capacity – base 2 summation of all the SSD storage assigned to the FSx filesystem.
* Latency – a representation of what the host facing workloads are experiencing, across both reads and writes. Ideally, Cloud Insights is sourcing this value directly, but this is often not the case. In lieu of the array offering this up, Cloud Insights is generally performing an IOPs-weighted calculation derived from the individual internal volumes’ statistics.
* Throughput – aggregated from internal volumes.
Management – this may contain a hyperlink for the management interface of the device. Created programmatically by the Cloud Insights data source as part of inventory reporting.

=== Storage Pool

* Storage – what storage array this pool lives on. Mandatory.
* Type – a descriptive value from a list of an enumerated list of possibilities. Most commonly will be “Aggregate” or “RAID Group””.
//* Node – if this storage array’s architecture is such that pools belong to a specific storage node, its name will be seen here as a hyperlink to its own landing page.
* Capacity – the values here are the logical used, usable capacity and the logical total capacity, and the percentage used across these.
* IOPS – the sum IOPs of all the volumes allocated on this storage pool.
* Throughput – the sum throughput of all the volumes allocated on this storage pool.

== Requirements

The following are requirements to configure and use this data collector:

* You must have access to an Administrator account configured for read-only API calls.
* Account details include username and password.
* Port requirements: 80 or 443


== Configuration

|Field|Description
|NetApp Management IP |IP address or fully-qualified domain name of the NetApp cluster
|User Name |User name for NetApp cluster
|Password |Password for NetApp cluster

== Advanced Metrics

This data collector collects the following advanced metrics from the FSx for NetApp ONTAP storage:

* fpolicy 
* nfsv3 
* nfsv3:node 
* nfsv4
* nfsv4_1
* nfsv4_1:node  
* nfsv4:node  
* policy_group
* qtree    
* volume  
* workload_volume 





== Troubleshooting
Some things to try if you encounter problems with this data collector:

=== Inventory

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:

|Receive 401 HTTP response or 13003 ZAPI error code and ZAPI returns “Insufficient privileges” or “not authorized for this command”| Check username and password, and user privileges/permissions.

|ZAPI returns "cluster role is not cluster_mgmt LIF"|AU needs to talk to cluster management IP. Check the IP and change to a different IP if necessary

|ZAPI command fails after retry| AU has communication problem with the cluster. Check network, port number, and IP address. User should also try to run a command from command line from the AU machine. 

|AU failed to connect to ZAPI via HTTP| Check whether ZAPI port accepts plaintext. If AU tries to send plaintext to an SSL socket, the communication fails.

|Communication fails with SSLException|AU is attempting to send SSL to a plaintext port on a filer. Check whether the ZAPI port accepts SSL, or use a different port.

|Additional Connection errors:

ZAPI response has error code 13001, “database  is not open”
  
ZAPI error code is 60 and response contains “API did not finish on time”
  
ZAPI response contains “initialize_session() returned NULL environment”
  
ZAPI error code is 14007 and response contains “Node is not healthy”

|Check network, port number, and IP address. User should also try to run a command from command line from the AU machine.
