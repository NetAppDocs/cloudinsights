= Using annotations

[.lead]
You create annotations to provide an enhanced picture of your data.
Annotations can define an asset end of life, the data center and building
location it resides in, or volume and internal volume service level. Annotations can be assigned manually, or can be assigned automatically using annotation rules.

== Manually assigning annotations to assets

.Before you begin
* List any industry terminology to which environment data must be associated.
* List corporate terminology to which environment data must be associated, which
is not already being tracked using the business entities.
* Identify any default annotation types that you might be able to use.
* Identify which custom annotations you need to create.
You need to create the annotation before it can be assigned to an asset.

Use the following steps to create an annotation. comment

.Steps
. In the Cloud Insights menu, click *Manage > Annotations*
. Click *+ Annotation* to create a new annotation.
. Enter a Name, Description, and type for the new annotation.
+
For example, enter the following to create a text annotation that defines the
physical location of an asset in Data Center 4:

.Steps
.. Enter a name for the annotation (Location)
.. Enter a description of what the annotation is describing (Physical location is Data Center 4)
.. Enter the 'type' of annotation it is (Text).

== Assigning annotations using annotation rules
[.lead]
To automatically assign annotations to assets based on criteria that you define, you configure annotation rules. Cloud Insights assigns the annotations to assets based on these rules. Cloud Insights also provides two default annotation rules, which you can modify to suit your needs or remove if you do not want to use them.

=== Default storage annotation rules

[.lead]
To expedite the assignment of storage annotations to your resources, OnCommand Insight includes 21 default annotation rules, which associate a tier level with a storage tier model. All of your storage resources are automatically associated with a tier upon acquisition of the assets in your environment.
The default annotation rules apply a tier annotations in the following way:

Tier 1, storage quality tier::
The Tier 1 annotation is applied to the following vendors and their specified families: EMC (Symmetrix), HDS (HDS9500V, HDS9900, HDS9900V, R600, R700, USP r, USP V), IBM (DS8000), NetApp (FAS6000 or FAS6200), and Violin (Memory).
Tier 2, storage quality tier::
The Tier 2 annotation is applied to the following vendors and their specified families: HP (3PAR StoreServ or EVA), EMC (CLARiiON), HDS (AMS or D800), IBM (XIV), and NetApp (FAS3000, FAS3100, and FAS3200).

You can edit the default settings of these rules to match your tier requirements, or you can remove them if you do not need them.

=== Creating annotation rules
[.lead]
As an alternative to manually applying annotations to individual assets, you can automatically apply annotations to multiple assets using annotation rules. Annotations set manually on an individual asset pages take precedence over rule-based annotations when Insight evaluates the annotation rules.
.Before you begin
You must have created a query for the annotation rule.

.About this task
Although you can edit the annotation types while you are creating the rules, you should have defined the types ahead of time.

.Steps

. Click *Manage > Annotation rules*
+
The Annotation Rules page displays the list of existing annotation rules.
. Click *+ Add*.
. Do the following:
.. In the *Name* box, enter a unique name that describes the rule.
+
This name will appear in the Annotation Rules page.
.. Click *Query* and select the query that is used to apply the annotation to assets.
.. Click *Annotation* and select the annotation you want to apply.
.. Click *Value* and select a value for the annotation.
+
For example, if you choose Birthday as the annotation, you specify a date for the value.
.. Click *Save*
.. Click *Run all rules* if you want to run all the rules immediately; otherwise, the rules are run at a regularly scheduled interval.
