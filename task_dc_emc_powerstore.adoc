The EMC PowerStore data collector gathers inventory information from EMC PowerStore storage. For configuration, the data collector requires the IP address of the storage processors and a read-only user name and password.

The EMC PowerStore data collector gathers the volume-to-volume replication relationships that PowerStore coordinates across other storage arrays. Data Infrastructure Insights shows a storage array for each PowerStore cluster, and collects inventory data for nodes and storage ports on that cluster. No storage pool or volume data is collected. 

== Terminology 

Data Infrastructure Insights acquires the following inventory information from this data collector. For each asset type acquired by Data Infrastructure Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

Cloud Insight's PowerStore performance collection makes use of PowerStore's 5-minute granularity source data. As such, Data Infrastructure Insights polls for that data every five minutes, and this is not configurable.
