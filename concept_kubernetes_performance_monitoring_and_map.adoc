The Kubernetes Network Performance and Map feature simplifies troubleshooting by mapping dependencies between Kubernetes workloads. It provides real-time visibility into Kubernetes network performance latencies and anomalies to identify performance issues before they affect users.
This capability helps organizations reduce overall costs by analyzing and auditing Kubernetes traffic flows.

NOTE: The Kubernetes Network Performance and Map is a link:concept_preview_features.html[Preview] feature and is subject to change.

Key Features:
• The Workload Map presents Kubernetes workload dependencies and flows and highlights network and performance issues.
• Monitor network traffic between Kubernetes pods, workloads, and nodes; identifies the source of traffic and latency problems.
• Reduce overall costs by analyzing ingress, egress, cross-region, and cross-zone network traffic.

== Pre-Requisites

Before you can use the Kubernetes Network Performance and Map, you must have configured the link:task_config_telegraf_agent_k8s.html[NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator] to enable this option. During deployment of the Operator, select the "Network Performance and Map" checkbox to enable. You can also enable this option by navigating to a Kubernetes landing page and selecting "Modify Deployment".

== The Map

The Map shows services (also called workloads) and their relationships to each other. Arrows show directions of traffic. Hovering over a workload displays summary information for that workload, as you can see in this simple example:

Icons within the circles represent different service types, to provide visibility into the relationships between each workload.
