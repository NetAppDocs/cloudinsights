Widgets on dashboards can be displayed with or without legends.

Legends in widgets can be turned on or off on a dashboard by either of the following methods:

. When editing the widget, check the *Show Legends* checkbox and save the widget.
. When displaying the dashboard, click the *Options* button on the widget and select *Show Legends* in the menu.

As you edit and change the data displayed in the widget, the legend for that widget is updated dynamically.

When legends are displayed, if the landing page of the asset indicated by the legend can be navigated to, the legend will display as a link to that asset page.
