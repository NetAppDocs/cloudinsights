Widgets on dashboards can be displayed with or without legends.

When displaying the dashboard, legends in widgets can be turned on or off by clicking the *Options* button on the widget and selecting *Show Legends* in the menu.

As the data displayed in the widget changes, the legend for that widget is updated dynamically.

When legends are displayed, if the landing page of the asset indicated by the legend can be navigated to, the legend will display as a link to that asset page.
