Cloud Cost provides a detailed cost analysis of past, present, and estimated spending, providing visibility into cloud usage in your environment. The Cloud Cost dashboard delivers a clear view of your organization's entire cloud expenses and a drill down into individual workloads, accounts, and services.

Cloud Cost can help with the following major challenges:

* Tracking and monitoring your cloud expenses
* Identifying waste and potential optimization areas
* Delivering executable action items

You must have Cloud Insights _Administrator_ or _Account Owner_ permissions to configure or view Cloud Cost. Once it has been configured, any Cloud Insights  user with those permissions can access it.

NOTE: Cloud Cost is available for US-Region Cloud Insights environments only.

==== Setting Up Cloud Cost

When you log in to Cloud Insights and click the *Cloud Cost* menu item, you are presented with a welcome screen and a prompt to begin setup of Cloud Cost. 

* Click the *Add AWS Credentials to Start* button to begin. You are presented with the AWS Connection screen. Follow the instructions on this screen to link your AWS account to Cloud Cost.
