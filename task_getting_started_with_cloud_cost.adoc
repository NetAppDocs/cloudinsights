Cloud Cost provides a detailed cost analysis of past, present, and estimated spending, providing visibility into cloud usage in your environment. The Cloud Cost dashboard delivers a clear view of your organization's cloud expenses and a drill down into individual workloads, accounts, and services.

Cloud Cost can help with the following major challenges:

* Tracking and monitoring your cloud expenses
* Identifying waste and potential optimization areas
* Delivering executable action items

You must have Cloud Insights _Administrator_ or _Account Owner_ permissions to configure or view Cloud Cost. Once it has been configured, any Cloud Insights user with those permissions can access Cloud Cost.

Configure Cloud Cost by linking it to your _AWS Organizations_ account. This is sometimes known as the link:https://docs.spot.io/cloud-analyzer/getting-started/connect-your-aws-master-payer-account-existing-customer[_master payer_] account.

NOTE: Cloud Cost is available for US-Region Cloud Insights environments only and can be configured for only a single AWS Organizations account. Cloud Cost must be configured separately from any AWS Collectors you may have in Cloud Insights. 

==== Setting Up Cloud Cost

When you log in to Cloud Insights and click the *Cloud Cost* menu item for the first time, you are presented with a welcome screen and a prompt to begin setup of Cloud Cost.
