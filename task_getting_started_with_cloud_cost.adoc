Cloud Cost provides a detailed cost analysis of past, present, and estimated spend, providing deep cross-cloud and cross-account visibility. The Cloud Cost dashboard delivers a clear view of your organization's entire cloud expenses and a drill down into individual workloads, accounts, and services.

Cloud Cost can help with the following major challenges:

* Tracking and monitoring your cloud expenses
* Identifying waste and potential optimization areas
* Delivering executable action items

You must have Cloud Insights _Administrator_ or _Account Owner_ permissions to configure or view Cloud Cost.

NOTE: Cloud Cost is available for US-Region Cloud Insights environments only.
