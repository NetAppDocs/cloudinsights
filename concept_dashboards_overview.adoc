Data Infrastructure Insights provides users the flexibility to create operational views of infrastructure data, by allowing you to create custom dashboards with a variety of widgets, each of which provides extensive flexibility in displaying and charting your data.

IMPORTANT: The examples in these sections are for explanation purposes only and do not cover every possible scenario. The concepts and steps herein can be used to create your own dashboards to highlight the data specific to your particular needs.

== Creating a Dashboard

You create a new dashboard in one of two places:

•	*Dashboards > [+New dashboard]*

•	*Dashboards > Show all dashboards >* click the *[+Dashboard]* button

== Dashboard Controls

The Dashboard screen has several controls:

•	*Time selector*: allows you to view dashboard data for a range of time from the last 15 minutes to the last 30 days, or a custom time range of up to 31 days. You can choose to override this global time range in individual widgets.

•	*Edit* button: Selecting this will enable Edit mode, which allows you to make changes to the dashboard. New dashboards open in Edit mode by default.

•	*Save* button: Allows you to save or delete the dashboard. 
+
You can rename the current dashboard by typing a new name before clicking *Save*.

//•	Variable button: Variables can be added to dashboards. Changing the variable updates all of your widgets at once. For more information on variables, see Custom Dashboard concepts

•	*Add Widget* button, which allows you to add any number of tables, charts, or other widgets to the dashboard.
+
Widgets can be resized and relocated to different positions within the dashboard, to give you the best view of your data according to your current needs.

== Widget types

You can choose from the following widget types:

* *Table widget*: A table displaying data according to filters and columns you choose. Table data can be combined in groups that can be collapsed and expanded.

* *Single Value widget*: A widget allowing you to display a single value that can be derived either directly from a counter or calculated using a query or expression. You can define color formatting thresholds to show whether the value is in expected, warning, or critical range.
