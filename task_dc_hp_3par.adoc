Cloud Insights uses the 3PAR StoreServ data collector to discover inventory and performance for HP 3PAR StoreServ storage arrays.

== Terminology 

Cloud Insights acquires the following inventory information from the 3PAR StoreServ data collector. For each asset type acquired by Cloud Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Field|Description
|Physical Disk|Disk
|Storage System|Storage
|Controller Node|Storage Node
|Common Provisioning Group|Storage Pool
|Virtual Volume|Volume
|===

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collector.

== Requirements

The following are required to configure this data colletor: 

* IP address or FQDN of the InServ cluster
* For inventory, read-only user name and password to the StoreServ Server
* For performance, read-write user name and password to the StoreServ Server
* Port requirements: 22 (inventory collection), 5988 or 5989 (performance collection) [Note: 3PAR Performance is supported for StoreServ OS 3.x+]
* For performance collection confirm that SMI-S is enabled by logging into the 3PAR array via SSH.

== Troubleshooting
Some things to try if you encounter problems with this data collector:

==== Inventory

////
error: "Cache server is waiting for the system manager"
Customer can take action.  What can customer do about this scenario?
////

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:
|"showsys" command doesn't return any result.
|Run "showsys" and "showversion -a" from the command line and check if the version is supported by 3PAR.
|===

==== Performance

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:
|Failed to connect or login. Provider initialization failed.
|An all-numeric array name can cause problems with SMI-S server. Try changing the array name.
|SMI-S user configured does not have any domain
|Grant appropriate domain privileges to the configured SMI-S user
