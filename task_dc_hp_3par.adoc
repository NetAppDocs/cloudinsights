Data Infrastructure Insights uses the HP Enterprise Alletra 9000 / HP Enterprise Primera (previously 3PAR)  data collector to discover inventory and performance.

== Terminology 

Data Infrastructure Insights acquires the following inventory information from this data collector. For each asset type acquired by Data Infrastructure Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Field|Description
|Physical Disk|Disk
|Storage System|Storage
|Controller Node|Storage Node
|Common Provisioning Group|Storage Pool
|Virtual Volume|Volume
|===

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collector.

== Requirements

The following are required to configure this data collector: 

* IP address or FQDN of the InServ cluster
* For inventory, read-only user name and password to the StoreServ Server
* For performance, read-write user name and password to the StoreServ Server
* Port requirements: 22 (inventory collection), 5988 or 5989 (performance collection) [Note: Performance is supported for StoreServ OS 3.x+]
* For performance collection confirm that SMI-S is enabled by logging into the array via SSH.

//|SSH Banner Wait Timeout (sec)|SSH banner wait timeout. The default is 20 seconds. 
|SMI-S Connectivity|Protocol used to connect to the SMI-S provider
|Override SMI-S Default Port|If blank, use the default port from SMI-S Connectivity, otherwise enter the connection port to use
//|SMI-S Password|Password used for the SMI-S Provider Host
//|SMI-S namespace|SMI-S namespace. The default path is root/PG_InterOp.

== Troubleshooting
Some things to try if you encounter problems with this data collector:

=== Inventory

////
error: "Cache server is waiting for the system manager"
Customer can take action.  What can customer do about this scenario?
////

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:
|"showsys" command doesn't return any result.
|Run "showsys" and "showversion -a" from the command line and check if the version is supported by the array.
|===

=== Performance

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:
|Failed to connect or login. Provider initialization failed.
|An all-numeric array name can cause problems with SMI-S server. Try changing the array name.
|SMI-S user configured does not have any domain
|Grant appropriate domain privileges to the configured SMI-S user

|Data Infrastructure Insights states that it cannot connect/login to SMI-S service.
|Confirm there is no firewall between the CI AU and the array that would block the CI AU from making TCP connections to 5988 or 5989.
Once that is done, and if you have confirmed there is no firewall, you should SSH to the array, and use the “showcim” command to confirm.

Verify that:

* Service is enabled
* HTTPS is enabled
*	HTTPS port should be 5989

If those all are so, you can try to “stopcim” and then a  “startcim” to restart the CIM (i.e. SMI-S service).
