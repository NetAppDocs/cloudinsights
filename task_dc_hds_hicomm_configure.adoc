The Hitachi Vantara Command Suite data collector supports the HiCommand Device Manager server. Cloud Insights communicates with the HiCommand Device Manager server using the standard HiCommand API.

== Terminology 

Cloud Insights acquires the following inventory information from the Hitachi Vantara Command Suite data collector. For each asset type acquired by Cloud Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Vendor/Model Term|Cloud Insights Term 
|PDEV|Disk
|Journal Pool|Disk Group
|Storage Array|Storage
|Port Controller|Storage Node
|Array Group, HDS Pool|Storage Pool
|Logical Unit, LDEV|Volume
|===

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collector. 

== Inventory Requirements

You must have the following in order to collect inventory data:

* IP address of the HiCommand Device Manager server
* Read-only user name and password for the HiCommand Device Manager software and peer privileges
* Port requirements: 2001 (http) or 2443 (https)
* Log into HiCommand Device Manager software using username and password 
* Verify access to HiCommand Device Manager http://<HDS HiCommand Device Manager IP Address>:2001/service/StorageManager 

== Performance requirements 

The following requirements must be met in order to collect performance data:

* HDS USP, USP V, and VSP performance 
** Performance Monitor must be licensed.
** Monitoring switch must be enabled. 
** The Export Tool (Export.exe) must be copied to the Cloud Insights AU.
** The Export Tool version must match the microcode version of the target array.

* AMS performance:
** NetApp strongly recommends creating a dedicated service account on AMS arrays for Cloud Insights to use to retrieve performance data. Storage Navigator only allows a user account one concurrent login to the array. Having Cloud Insights use the same user account as management scripts or HiCommand may result in Cloud Insights, management scripts, or HiCommand being unable to communicate to the array due to the one concurrent user account login limit
** Performance Monitor must be licensed.
** The Storage Navigator Modular 2 (SNM2) CLI utility needs to be installed on the Cloud Insights AU.
