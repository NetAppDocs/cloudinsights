Here you will find suggestions for troubleshooting problems with Acquisition Units on a Linux server.

|===
|*Problem:* | *Try this:*
|AU status on the *Observability > Collectors* page in the *Acquisition Units* tab displays "Certificate Expired” or “Certificate Revoked” .
|Click on the menu to the right of the AU and select *Restore Connection*. Follow the instructions to restore your Acquisition Unit:

1. Stop the Acquisition Unit (AU) service. You can click the _Copy Stop Command_ button to quickly copy the command to the clipboard, then paste this command into a command prompt on the acquisition unit machine.

2. Create a file named "token" in the _/var/lib/netapp/cloudinsights/acq/conf_ folder on the AU.

3. Click the _Copy Token_ button, and paste this token into the file you created.

4. Restart the AU service. Click the _Copy Restart Command_ button, and paste the command into a command prompt on the AU.

|Permission denied when starting the Acquisition Unit Server Service|When the AU is installed on SELINUX, SE should be set to _permissive_ mode. _Enforcing_ mode is not supported. After setting SELINUX to permissive mode, restart the AU service.  link:https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Cloud_Services/Cloud_Insights/Permission_denied_when_starting_the_Cloud_Insight_Acquisition_Unit_Server_Service[Learn more].

|Server Requirements not met | Ensure that your Acquisition Unit server or VM meets  link:concept_acquisition_unit_requirements.html[requirements]

|Network Requirements not met |Ensure that your Acquisition Unit server/VM can access your Data Infrastructure Insights environment (<environment-name>.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com) through SSL connection over port 443. Try the following commands:

 _ping <environment-name>.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com_
_traceroute <environment-name>.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com_
_curl \https://<environment-name>.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com_
_wget \https://<environment-name>.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com_

|Proxy Server not configured properly | Verify your proxy settings, and uninstall/re-install the Acquisition Unit software if necessary to enter the correct proxy settings.

1. Try "curl".  Refer to "man curl" information/documentation regarding proxies: --preproxy, --proxy-* (that's a wildcard "*" because curl supports many proxy settings).
2. Try "wget".  Check documentation for proxy options.

|Acquisition unit installation failed in Data Infrastructure Insights with credential errors while starting acquisition service (and visible in the acq.log).|This can be caused by the inclusion of special characters in the proxy credentials. Uninstall the AU (_sudo cloudinsights-uninstall.sh_) and reinstall without using special characters.

|Linux: missing library / file not found| Ensure that your Linux Acquisition Unit server/VM has all necessary libraries. For example, you must have the _unzip_ library installed on the server. To install the _unzip_ library, run the command _*sudo yum install unzip*_ before running the Acquisition Unit install script

|Permission issues| Be sure you are logged in as a user with _sudo_ permissions

|Acquisition Not Running:
| Gather the acq.log from /opt/netapp/cloudinsights/acq/logs (Linux)
Restart the Acquisition Service: sudo cloudinsights-service.sh restart acquisition

|Data Collection Issues:
|Send an Error Report from the Data Collector landing page by clicking the "Send Error Report" button

|Status: Heartbeat Failed
|The Acquisition Unit (AU) sends a heartbeat to Data Infrastructure Insights every 60 seconds to renew its lease. If the heartbeat call fails due to network issue or unresponsive Data Infrastructure Insights, the AU's lease time isn't updated. When the AU's lease time expires, Data Infrastructure Insights shows a status of "Heartbeat Failed".

Troubleshoot steps:

Check the network connection between the Acquisition Unit sever and CloudInsights.
Check whether the Acquisition Unit service is running. If the service is not running, start the service.
Check the Acquisition Unit log (/var/log/netapp/cloudinsights/acq/acq.log) to see whether there are any errors.

|I'm seeing a "Heartbeat Error:" message
|This error can occur if there is a network interruption that causes communication between the Acquisition Unit and the Data Infrastructure Insights environment to be interrupted for more than one minute. Verify the connection between the AU and Data Infrastructure Insights is stable and active.

|When Re-Installing the Acquisition Unit, I'm seeing "ValueError: File context for /opt/netapp/cloudinsights(/.*)? already defined".
|On a system with SELinux, This error message may appear after `cloudinsights-uninstall.sh -p` has been executed and the Acquisition Unit is to be reinstalled. Running the command `semanage fcontext -d -t usr_t "/opt/netapp/cloudinsights(/.*)?"` should correct the issue and remove the message.

== Considerations about Proxies and Firewalls

If your organization requires proxy usage for internet access, you may need to understand your organization’s proxy behavior and seek certain exceptions for Data Infrastructure Insights to work. Keep the following in mind:

* First, does your organization block access by default, and only allow access to specific web sites/domains by exception? If so, you will need to get the following domain added to the exception list:
+
 *.cloudinsights.netapp.com
+
Your Data Infrastructure Insights Acquisition Unit, as well as your interactions in a web browser with Data Infrastructure Insights, will all go to hosts with that domain name. 

* Second, some proxies attempt to perform TLS/SSL inspection by impersonating Data Infrastructure Insights web sites with digital certificates not generated from NetApp. The Data Infrastructure Insights Acquisition Unit’s security model is fundamentally incompatible with these technologies. You would also need the above domain name excepted from this functionality in order for the Data Infrastructure Insights Acquisition Unit to successfully login to Data Infrastructure Insights and facilitate data discovery.


In case where the proxy is set up for traffic inspection, the Data Infrastructure Insights environment must be added to an exception list in the proxy configuration. The format and setup of this exception list varies according to your proxy environment and tools, but in general you must add the URLs of the Data Infrastructure Insights servers to this exception list in order to allow the AU to properly communicate with those servers.

The simplest way to do this is to add the Data Infrastructure Insights domain itself to the exception list:

 *.cloudinsights.netapp.com
 
In the case where the proxy is not set up for traffic inspection, an exception list may or may not be required. If you are unsure whether you need to add Data Infrastructure Insights to an exception list, or if you experience difficulties installing or running Data Infrastructure Insights due to proxy and/or firewall configuration, talk to your proxy administration team to set up the proxy's handling of SSL interception.

=== Viewing Proxy endpoints

You can view your proxy endpoints by clicking the *Proxy Settings* link when choosing a data collector during onboarding, or the link under _Proxy Settings_ on the *Help > Support* page. A table like the following is displayed. If you have Workload Security in your environment, the configured endpoint URLs will also be displayed in this list.
