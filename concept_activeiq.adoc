NetApp link:https://www.netapp.com/us/products/data-infrastructure-management/active-iq.aspx[Active IQ] provides a series of visualizations, analytics, and other support-related services to NetApp customers for their hardware / software systems. The data reported by Active IQ can enhance troubleshooting of system problems and also provide insight into optimization and predictive analysis related to your device estate.   

Cloud Insights collects the *Risks* for any NetApp Clustered Data OnTap storage system that is monitored and reported by Active IQ. You do not need to configure Cloud Insights to collect this information; any risks reported for the relevant storage systems are collected automatically by Cloud Insights as part of its data acquisition of those devices. 

The risks reported are shown in Cloud Insights on the relevant _storage_ and _storage node_ asset landing pages, in the "Risks" table. The table shows Risk Detail, Category of risk, and Potential Impact of the risk, and also provides a link to the Active IQ page for the relevant storage node (Active IQ account sign-in required).
