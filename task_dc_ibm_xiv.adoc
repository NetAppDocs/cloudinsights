IBM XIV and A9000 (CLI) data collector uses the XIV command-line interface to collect inventory data while performance collection is accomplished by making SMI-S calls to the XIV/A9000 array, which runs a SMI-S provider on port 7778.

== Requirements

The following requirements must be met to configure and use this data collector:

* Port requirement: TCP port 7778
* Read-only user name and password
* The XIV CLI must be installed on the AU

== Performance requirements 

The following are requirements for performance collection:

* SMI-S Agent 1.4 or higher 

* SMI-S compatible CIMService running on array.  Most XIV arrays have a CIMServer installed by default. 

* User login must be provided for the CIMServer.  The login must have full read access to the array configuration and properties. 

* SMI-S namespace.  Default is root/ibm.  This is configurable in the CIMServer. 

* Port Requirements: 5988 for HTTP, 5989 for HTTPS. 

*  Refer to the following link on how to create an account for SMI-S performance collection: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/products?topic=/com.ibm.tpc_V41.doc/fqz0_t_adding_cim_agent.html
