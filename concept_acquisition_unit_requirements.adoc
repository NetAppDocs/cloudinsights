You must install an Acquisition Unit (AU) in order to acquire information from your infrastructure data collectors (storage, VM, port, EC2, etc.). Before you install the Acquisition Unit, you should ensure that your environment meets operating system, CPU, memory, and disk space requirements.

=== Requirements

|===
|Component | Linux Requirement | Windows Requirement
|Operating system	
|A computer running a licensed version of one of the following:

* Centos (64-bit): 7.2 through 7.9, 8.1 through 8.2
* Debian (64-bit): 9
* Oracle Enterprise Linux (64-bit): 7.5 through 7.9, 8.1 through 8.2
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (64-bit): 7.2 through 7.9, 8.1 through 8.2
* Ubuntu Server: 18.04 LTS

This computer should be running no other application-level software. A dedicated server is recommended. 
|A computer running a licensed version of one of the following:

* Microsoft Windows 10 64-bit
* Microsoft Windows Server 2012
* Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2
* Microsoft Windows Server 2016
* Microsoft Windows Server 2019

This computer should be running no other application-level software. A dedicated server is recommended. 
|CPU	|2 CPU cores 
| Same
|Memory	|8 GB RAM 
| Same
|Available disk space	|50 GB 
For Linux, disk space should be allocated in this manner:
/opt/netapp 25 GB
/var/log/netapp 25 GB
|50 GB
|Network	|100 Mbps /1 Gbps Ethernet connection, static IP address, IP connectivity to all FC devices, and a required port to the Cloud Insights instance (80 or 443). 
|Same 
|Permissions	|Sudo permissions on the Acquisition Unit server.  
/tmp must be mounted with exec capabilities.
|Administrator permissions on the Acquisition Unit server
|Virus Scan |  | During installation, you must completely disable all virus scanners. Following installation, the paths used by the Acquisition Unit software must be excluded from virus scanning.
