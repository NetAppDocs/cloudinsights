== Login issues

|===
|*Problem:* | *Try this:* 

|Data Infrastructure Insights automatically logs out every 6 hours
|This is due to disabled browser third-party cookies. Users can configure their browser to enable all 3rd party cookies, or use a narrower exception list to just enable those for Data Infrastructure Insights.
 
Example:
Open your browser's settings
 
Select the "Allow all cookies" option.
*OR*
Select "Block third-party cookies" and add exceptions for _[\*.]auth0.com_ and _[*.]netapp.com_.

Microsoft Edge folows the same format for exceptions as Chrome.

In Firefox, cookie exceptions are designated as simply _auth0.com_ and _netapp.com_.


 
//Note: Make sure to select the "Including third-party cookies on this site" option when creating an exception. 

|I have a BlueXP account but am unable to login to BlueXP.
|Open a ticket from https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/help. Select category “blueXP.netapp.com > Account/Login issues” or “bluexp.netapp.com > Federation issues”.  These are specifically for BlueXP issues or questions.
For all other Data Infrastructure Insights technical support issues, contact link:concept_requesting_support.html[NetApp support]. 

|I got invited to Data Infrastructure Insights but I get a "not authorized" message.
|Verify that you have signed up for a BlueXP account, or that your organization uses SSO login with BlueXP.

Verify your BlueXP profile email address matches email address shown in your Data Infrastructure Insights welcome email. If the email does not match, request a new invitation with the correct email address.

|I logged out from BlueXP and was automatically logged out from Data Infrastructure Insights. |Single Sign-On (SSO) across NetApp Cloud Services logs out all Data Infrastructure Insights sessions. If you have access to multiple Data Infrastructure Insights accounts, logging out from any one logs out all active sessions. Log back in to access your account.

|I was automatically logged out after several days.
|NetApp Cloud accounts require reauthentication every few days (current BlueXP setting is 7 days). Log back in to access your account.

|I receive an error message “no longer authorized to login”.
|Contact your account administrator to verify access to Data Infrastructure Insights. 
Verify your BlueXP profile email address matches email address shown in your Data Infrastructure Insights welcome email

|Other login errors
|Try incognito mode in Chrome, or clear browser history, cookies, and cache. 
Try with a different browser profile (i.e. Chrome - add Person).

== Other Issues

|*Question:* | *Answer:* 

|My Qtree hard quotas are showing correctly in queries, but my soft quotas are showing as the total capacity of the volume. Is that correct?
|Only hard quotas--either manually set or set through Trident--will show as the set quotas; if no hard quotas are specified, the Qtree capacity will be the internal volume capacity.

|I have both a soft and a hard quota manually set in the same Qtree, but the total capacity showing is the hard quota; is that correct?
|Yes, if a hard quota is specified, that will be shown as the total capacity.

|When entering a Cognos report schedule time, sometimes I end up with an extra "m" in the schedule time. For example, if I enter the time as "02:15 PM", it may add an extra character: "02:15 PMM" (or PMm). When I click outside, it changes it to "2:15 AM".

I am able to save the report, but when I re-open the saved report, the schedule time appears as AM (i.e. morning), regardless of whether I entered AM or PM in the schedule time.
|Re-enter the schedule time, being careful not to enter the full "AM" or "PM" characters; it is enough to type "A" for "AM or "P" for "PM". If you are not shown the extra character, the schedule time will be set correctly.
