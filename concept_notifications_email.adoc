To add recipients to the global email list, click on *Admin > Notifications*, and enter email addresses for the recipients separated by commas. Emails sent as alerts from performance policy threshold violations will be sent to all recipients on the list. 

If you make a mistake, you can click on [x] to remove a recipient from the list.

You can also add an optional signature block that will be attached to the email notifications sent.

NOTE: You can override the global list for a link:task_create_performance_policies.html[specific policy] when you configure that policy.
