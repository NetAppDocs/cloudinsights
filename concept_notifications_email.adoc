== Subscription Notification Recipients

To configure recipients for subscription-related event notifications, go to the "Subscription Notification Recipients" section. 
You can choose to have email notifications sent for subscription-related events to any or all of the following recipients:

* All Account Owners
* All _Monitor & Optimize_ Administrators
* Additional Email Addresses that you specify

The following are examples of the types of notifications that might be sent, and user actions you can take.

== Global Recipient List for Alerts

Email notifications of alerts are sent to the alert recipient list for every action on the alert. You can choose to send alert notifications to a global recipient list.

To configure global alert recipients, choose the desired recipients in the *Global Monitor Notification Recipients* section.

You can always override the global recipients list for an individual monitor when creating or modifying the monitor.

NOTE: ONTAP Data Collector notifications take precedence over any specific Monitor notifications that are relevant to the cluster/data collector. The recipient list you set for the Data Collector itself will receive the data collector alerts. If there are no active data collector alerts, then monitor-generated alerts will be sent to specific monitor recipients.

== Editing Notifications for ONTAP

You can modify notifications for ONTAP clusters by selecting _Edit Notifications_ from the upper-right drop-down on a Storage landing page.

From here, you can set notifications for Critical, Warning, Informational, and/or Resolved alerts. Each scenario can notify the Global Recipient list or other recipients you choose.
