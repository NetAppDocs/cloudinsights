You can configure a global email list of recipients for notification of performance policy threshold violations. You can also configure an email list specifically for subscription-related notifications.

== Global Recipient List

To add recipients to the global email list, click on *Admin > Notifications*, and enter email addresses for the recipients separated by commas. Emails sent as alerts from performance policy threshold violations will be sent to all recipients on the list. 

If you make a mistake, you can click on [x] to remove a recipient from the list.

You can also add an optional signature block that will be attached to the email notifications sent.

NOTE: You can override the global list for a link:task_create_performance_policies.html[specific policy] when you configure that policy.

== Subscription Notification Recipients

You can choose to have email notifications sent for subscription-related events to any or all of the following recipients:

* All Account Owners
* All Administrators
* Additional Email Addresses that you specify

////
A notification email will be sent to the selected recipients when any of the following events occur:

==== Informational notifications:

* Your trial ends in two days
* Your subscription has been updated
* Your subscription will expire in 3 months

==== Critical notifications:

* Your trial subscription has ended
* Your trial account will stop collecting data in 48 hours
* Your trial account will be deleted after 48 hours
* Your subscription will expire in 1 month
* Your subscription has expired
* Your expired account will stop collecting data in 48 hours
* Your expired account will be deleted after 48 hours
