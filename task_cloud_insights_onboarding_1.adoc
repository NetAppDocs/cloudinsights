== Starting your Cloud Insights free trial

If this is your first time logging in to Cloud Insights, under the Cloud Insights offering, click on *Start Free Trial*. Cloud Insights will walk you through creating your company's environment.

== Sign in and go

Once your environment has been created, at any time you can simply log in to the NetApp Cloud Portal and click *Go to Cloud Insights*. You will be taken directly to your Cloud Insights environment.

You can also open a browser directly to your Cloud Insights environment URL, for example:

 https://<environment-prefix>.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com/

The URL will also be included in each user's invitation email for simple access and bookmarking. If the user is not already logged in to Cloud Central, they will be prompted to log in.

NOTE: New users must still sign up for access to Cloud Central before they can access their environment URL.

The first time you log in to a new environment, you will be guided through setting up to link:task_getting_started_with_cloud_insights.html[*begin gathering data*].

== Logging Out

To log out of Cloud Insights, click your *User Name* and select *Log Out*. You will be taken back to the Cloud Central sign in screen.

NOTE: Logging out of Cloud Insights logs you out of Cloud Central. You will also be logged out of other NetApp Cloud services that use the Cloud Central sign-in.

=== Inactivity Timeout

By default, BlueXP will log a user out if there is no activity in 6 hours (360 minutes). Regardless of activity, users will be logged out after 365 days.
