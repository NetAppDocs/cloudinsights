Cloud Insights uses link:https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf[Telegraf] as its agent for collection of integration data. Telegraf is a plugin-driven server agent that can be used to collect and report metrics, events, and logs. Input plugins are used to collect the desired information into the agent by accessing the system/OS directly, by calling third-party APIs, or by listening to configured streams (i.e. Kafka, statsD, etc). Output plugins are used to send the collected metrics, events, and logs from the agent to Cloud Insights. 

The current Telegraf version for Cloud Insights is *1.24.0*.

For information on installing on Kubernetes, see link:task_config_telegraf_agent_k8s.html[this page].

NOTE: For accurate audit and data reporting, it is strongly recommended to synchronize the time on the Agent machine using *Network Time Protocol (NTP)* or *Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)*.

NOTE: If you want to verify the installation files before instaling the Agent, see the section below on <<Verifying Checksums>>.

== Installing an Agent

If you are installing a Service data collector and have not yet configured an Agent, you are prompted to first install an Agent for the appropriate Operating System. This topic provides instructions for installing the Telegraf agent on the following Operating Systems:

* <<Windows>>
* <<RHEL and CentOS>>
* <<Ubuntu and Debian>>

To install an agent, regardless of the platform you are using, you must first do the following:

. Log into the host you will use for your agent. 
. Log in to your Cloud Insights environment and navigate to *Observability > Collectors*.
. Click on *+Data Collector* and choose a data collector to install. 

. Choose the appropriate platform for your host (Windows, Linux)
. Follow the remaining steps for each platform.

NOTE: Once you have installed an agent on a host, you do not need to install an agent again on that host. 

TIP: Once you have installed an agent on a server/VM, Cloud Insights collects metrics from that system in addition to collecting from any data collectors you configure. These metrics are gathered as link:task_config_telegraf_node.html["Node" metrics].

NOTE: If you are using a proxy, read the proxy instructions for your platform before installing the Telegraf agent.

=== Log Locations

Telegraf log messages are redirected from stdout to the following log files be default:

* RHEL/CentOS: /var/log/telegraf/telegraf.log
* Ubuntu/Debian: /var/log/telegraf/telegraf.log
* Windows: C:\Program Files\telegraf\telegraf.log


=== Windows

==== Pre-requisites:

* PowerShell must be installed
* If you are behind a proxy, you must follow the instructions in the *Configuring Proxy Support for Windows* section. 


==== Configuring Proxy Support for Windows

NOTE: If your environment uses a proxy, read this section before you install.

NOTE: The steps below outline the actions needed to set the _http_proxy/https_proxy_ environment variables. For some proxy environments, users may also need to set the _no_proxy environment_ variable.

For systems residing behind a proxy, perform the following to set the _https_proxy_ and/or _http_proxy_ environment variable(s) *PRIOR* to installing the Telegraf agent:

 [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable(“https_proxy”, “<proxy_server>:<proxy_port>”, [System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)

== Verifying Checksums

The Cloud Insights agent installer performs integrity checks, but some users may want to perform their own verifications before installing or applying downloaded artifacts. This can be done by downloading the installer and generating a checksum for the downloaded package, then comparing the checksum to the value shown in the install instructions.



=== Download the installer package without installing

To perform a download-only operation (as opposed to the default download-and-install), users can edit the agent installation command obtained from the UI and remove the trailing “install” option.

Follow these steps:

. Copy the Agent Installer snippet as directed.
. Instead of pasting the snippet into a command window, paste it into a text editor.
. Remove the trailing “--install” (Linux) or “-install” (Windows) from the command.
. Copy the entire command from the text editor.
. Now paste it into your command window (in a working directory) and run it.

Non-Windows (these examples are for Kubernetes; actual script names may vary):

* Download and install (default):

 installerName=cloudinsights-kubernetes.sh … && sudo -E -H ./$installerName --download –-install

* Download-only:

 installerName=cloudinsights-kubernetes.sh … && sudo -E -H ./$installerName --download

Windows:

* Download and install (default):

 !$($installerName=".\cloudinsights-windows.ps1") … -and $(&$installerName -download -install)

*	Download-only:

 !$($installerName=".\cloudinsights-windows.ps1") … -and $(&$installerName -download)


The download-only command will download all required artifacts from Cloud Insights to the working directory. The artifacts include, but may not be limited to: 

* an installation script
* an environment file
* YAML files
* a signed checksum file (ending in sha256.signed or sha256.ps1)
* a PEM file (netapp_cert.pem) for signature verification

The installation script, environment file, and YAML files can be verified using visual inspection. 

The PEM file can be verified by confirming its fingerprint to be the following:

// E5:FB:7B:68:C0:8B:1C:A9:02:70:85:84:C2:74:F8:EF:C7:BE:8A:BC

 1A918038E8E127BB5C87A202DF173B97A05B4996

More specifically,

*	Non-Windows:

 openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha1 -noout -inform pem -in netapp_cert.pem

*	Windows:

 Import-Certificate -Filepath .\netapp_cert.pem -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\Root


=== Generate checksum value

To generate the checksum value, perform the following command for your appropriate platform:

* RHEL/Ubuntu:

 sha256sum <package_name>
 
 
* Windows:

 Get-FileHash telegraf.zip -Algorithm SHA256 | Format-List



=== Verify checksum using PEM file

The signed checksum file can be verified using the PEM file:

*	Non-Windows:

// openssl smime -verify -in sha256.signed -CAfile netapp_cert.pem -purpose any

 openssl smime -verify -in telegraf*.sha256.signed -CAfile netapp_cert.pem -purpose any


*	Windows (after installing the certificate via Import-Certificate above):

// Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath .\sha256.ps1 $result = Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath .\sha256.ps1 $signer = $result.SignerCertificate Add-Type -Assembly System.Security [Security.Cryptography.x509Certificates.X509Certificate2UI]::DisplayCertificate($signer)

 Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath .\telegraf.zip.sha256.ps1 
 $result = Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath .\telegraf.zip.sha256.ps1 
 $signer = $result.SignerCertificate 
 Add-Type -Assembly System.Security 
 [Security.Cryptography.x509Certificates.X509Certificate2UI]::DisplayCertificate($signer)


=== Install the downloaded package

Once all of the artifacts have been satisfactorily verified, the agent installation can be initiated by running:

Non-Windows:

 sudo -E -H ./<installation_script_name> --install

Windows:

 .\cloudinsights-windows.ps1 -install
 



== Troubleshooting

Some things to try if you encounter problems setting up an agent:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:

|After configuring a new plugin and restarting Telegraf, Telegraf fails to start up. The logs indicate that an error resembling the following:

"[telegraf] Error running agent: Error loading config file /etc/telegraf/telegraf.d/cloudinsights-default.conf: plugin outputs.http: line <linenumber>: configuration specified the fields ["use_system_proxy"], but they weren't used"

|The installed Telegraf version is outdated. Follow the steps on this page to *Upgrade the Agent* for your appropriate platform.

|I ran the installer script on an old installation and now the agent isn’t sending data
|Uninstall the telegraf agent and then re-run the installation script. Follow the *Upgrade the Agent* steps on this page for your appropriate platform.



|I already installed an agent using Cloud Insights| If you have already installed an agent on your host/VM, you do not need to install the agent again. In this case, simply choose the appropriate Platform and Key in the Agent Installation screen, and click on *Continue* or *Finish*. 

|I already have an agent installed but not by using the Cloud Insights installer|Remove the previous agent and run the Cloud Insights Agent installation, to ensure proper default configuration file settings. When complete, click on *Continue* or *Finish*.
