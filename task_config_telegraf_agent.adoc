[.lead]
Cloud Insights uses link:https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.19/[Telegraf] as its agent for collection of integration data. Telegraf is a plugin-driven server agent that can be used to collect and report metrics, events, and logs. Input plugins are used to collect the desired information into the agent by accessing the system/OS directly, by calling third-party APIs, or by listening to configured streams (i.e. Kafka, statsD, etc). Output plugins are used to send the collected metrics, events, and logs from the agent to Cloud Insights. 

The current Telegraf version for Cloud Insights is *1.19.3*.

NOTE: For accurate audit and data reporting, it is strongly recommended to synchronize the time on the Agent machine using *Network Time Protocol (NTP)* or *Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)*.

//NOTE: If you want to verify the installation files before instaling the Agent, see the section below on <<Verifying Checksums>>.

== Installing an Agent

If you are installing a Service data collector and have not yet configured an Agent, you are prompted to first install an Agent for the appropriate Operating System. This topic provides instructions for installing the Telegraf agent on the following Operating Systems:

* <<Windows>>
* <<RHEL and CentOS>>
* <<Ubuntu and Debian>>
* <<macOS>>
* <<Kubernetes>>

To install an agent, regardless of the platform you are using, you must first do the following:

. Log into the host you will use for your agent. 
. Log in to your Cloud Insights site and go to *Admin > Data Collectors*.
. Click on *+Data Collector* and choose a data collector to install. 
////
There are several types of data collectors:
+
* *Host* (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)
+
* *Service* (integration with a wide variety of agent-collected plugins). Agents are configured and run as a service for RHEL/CentOS, Ubuntu/Debian, macOS, and Windows. For Kubernetes platforms, the agent in configured as a DaemonSet.
+
* *Infrastructure* (collects from storage, switch, cloud platform, etc.). Infrastructure collection is done with an link:task_configure_acquisition_unit.html[Acquisition Unit] instead of an Agent.
////
. Choose the appropriate platform for your host (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)
. Follow the remaining steps for each platform.

NOTE: Once you have installed an agent on a host, you do not need to install an agent again on that host. 

TIP: Once you have installed an agent on a server/VM, Cloud Insights collects metrics from that system in addition to collecting from any data collectors you configure. These metrics are gathered as link:task_config_telegraf_node.html["Node" metrics].

NOTE: If you are using a proxy, read the proxy instructions for your platform before installing the Telegraf agent.

=== Windows

=== Kubernetes

Kubernetes offers two ways to collect data:

* Operator-based configuration. This is recommended for Kubernetes.
* Traditional script-based Agent installation

Installation instructions vary based on which tile you choose.

image:Kubernetes_Operator_Tile_Choices.png[Kubernetes Installation Choices]

NOTE: Operator-based installation is considered a _Preview_ feature and is therefore subject to change.


.Pre-requisites:

* The following commands must be available: curl, sudo, kubectl
+
For best results, add these commands to the PATH.

* kube-state-metrics must be installed. See below for more information.

* If you are behind a proxy, follow the instructions in the *Configuring Proxy Support for Kubernetes* section. 

* If you are running a Kubernetes variant that requires security context constraints, follow the instructions in the *Configuring the Agent to Collect Data from Kubernetes* section.

* You must have permissions to create Kubernetes cluster roles and role bindings.

* Operator-based installation has been tested and is expected to work with AWS EKS 1.18 and OpenShift 3.11.


==== Monitoring is only installed on Linux nodes

Cloud Insights supports monitoring of Kubernetes nodes that are running Linux, by specifying a Kubernetes node selector that looks for the following Kubernetes labels on these platforms:

|===
|Platform|Label

|Kubernetes v1.14 and above |Kubernetes.io/os = linux
|Kubernetes v1.13 and below |beta.kubernetes.io/os = linux
|Rancher + cattle.io as orchestration/Kubernetes platform |cattle.io/os = linux
|===


==== Operator-Based Installation

image:Kubernetes_Operator_Agent_Instructions.png[Operator-Based Install]

.Steps to install Operator-based agent on Kubernetes:

. Enter the cluster name and namespace.
. Once these are entered, you can copy the Agent Installer snippet
. Click the button to copy this snippet to the clipboard.
. Paste the snippet into a _bash_ window.
. The installation proceeds automatically. When it is complete, click the _Complete Setup_ button.


==== Script-Based Installation

image:Kubernetes_Install_Agent_screen.png[Script-Based Install]

.Steps to install agent on Kubernetes:

. Choose an Agent Access Key.
. Click the *Copy Agent Installer Snippet* button in the installation dialog. You can optionally click the _+Reveal Agent Installer Snippet_ button if you want to view the command block.
. Paste the command into a _bash_ window.
. Optionally, you can override the namespace or provide the cluster name as part of the install command by modifying the command block to add one or both of the following before the final _./$installerName_
** CLUSTER_NAME=<Cluster Name>
** NAMESPACE=<Namespace>
+
Scroll through the following example to see this in place in the command block:
+
 installerName=cloudinsights-kubernetes.sh && token=<token> && key=c642e336-91f4-4c6f-8086-72faabd6aff6 && domain=tenant1.testk8.cloudinsights-test.netapp.com && curl -k -X GET -H "Authorization: Bearer $token" -H "X-CloudInsights-ApiKey-Id: $key" -o $installerName https://$domain/rest/v1/lake/telegraf/platforms/installer?platform=kubernetes && chmod +x $installerName && sudo --preserve-env JWT=$token DOMAIN_NAME=$domain API_KEY_ID=$key CLUSTER_NAME=TEST_CLUSTER NAMESPACE=NEW-NAMESPACE ./$installerName
+
TIP: _CLUSTER_NAME_ is the name of the Kubernetes cluster from Cloud Insights collects metrics, while _NAMESPACE_ is the namespace to which the Telegraf agent will be deployed. The specified namespace will be created if it does not already exist.
+
. When ready, execute the command block.
. The command will download the appropriate agent installer, install it, and set a default configuration. If you have not explicitly set the _namespace_, you will be prompted to enter it. When finished, the script will restart the agent service. The command has a unique key and is valid for 24 hours. 
// . If you have already installed an agent on this host, you can skip the previous step.
. When finished, click *Complete Setup*.

A DaemonSet and ReplicaSet will be created on the Kubernetes cluster to run the required Telegraf agents/pods. By default, these Telegraf agents/pods will be scheduled on both master and non-master nodes.

To facilitate stopping and restarting of the agent, generate the Telegraf DaemonSet YAML and ReplicaSet YAML using the following commands. Note that these commands are using the default namespace "ci-monitoring".  If you have set your own namespace, substitute that namespace in these and all subsequent commands and files:

If you have set your own namespace, substitute that namespace in these and all subsequent commands and files:

 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring get ds telegraf-ds -o yaml > /tmp/telegraf-ds.yaml 
 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring get rs telegraf-rs -o yaml > /tmp/telegraf-rs.yaml

You can then use the following commands to stop and start the Telegraf service:

 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete ds telegraf-ds
 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete rs telegraf-rs
 
 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring apply -f /tmp/telegraf-ds.yaml 
 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring apply -f /tmp/telegraf-rs.yaml
 

 
==== Configuring Proxy Support for Kubernetes

NOTE: The steps below outline the actions needed to set the _http_proxy/https_proxy_ environment variables. For some proxy environments, users may also need to set the _no_proxy environment_ variable.

For systems residing behind a proxy, perform the following to set the _https_proxy_ and/or _http_proxy_ environment variable(s) for the current user *PRIOR* to installing the Telegraf agent:

 export https_proxy=<proxy_server>:<proxy_port>

*AFTER* installing the Telegraf agent, add and set the appropriate _https_proxy_ and/or _http_proxy_ environment variable(s) to the _telegraf-ds_ daemonset and _telegraf-rs_ replicaset.

 kubectl edit ds telegraf-ds

 …
        env:
        - name: https_proxy
          value: <proxy_server>:<proxy_port>
        - name: HOSTIP
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              apiVersion: v1
              fieldPath: status.hostIP
 …

 kubectl edit rs telegraf-rs

 …
        env:
        - name: https_proxy
          value: <proxy_server>:<proxy_port>
        - name: HOSTIP
          valueFrom:
            fieldRef:
              apiVersion: v1
              fieldPath: status.hostIP
 …

Then, restart Telegraf:

 kubectl delete pod telegraf-ds-*
 kubectl delete pod telegraf-rs-*


 
==== Configuring the Agent to Collect Data from Kubernetes

For Kubernetes environments, Cloud Insights deploys the Telegraf agent as a DaemonSet and a ReplicaSet. The pods in which the agents run need to have access to the following:

* hostPath
* configMap
* secrets

These Kubernetes objects are automatically created as part of the Kubernetes agent install command provided in the Cloud Insights UI. Some variants of Kubernetes, such as OpenShift, implement an added level of security that may block access to these components. The _SecurityContextConstraint_ is not created as part of the Kubernetes agent install command provided in the Cloud Insights UI, and must be created manually. Once created, restart the Telegraf pod(s).

//In such cases, an additional manual step may be required.  As an example, for OpenShift, you may need to create a _SecurityContextConstraint_ to grant the telegraf-user ServiceAccount access to these components.

==== Installing the kube-state-metrics server

NOTE: Operator-based install handles the installation of kube-state-metrics. These steps are threfore not required for operator-based installation.

When you install the kube-state-metrics server you can enable collection of the following Kubernetes objects: StatefulSet, DaemonSet, Deployment, PV, PVC, ReplicaSet, Service, Namespace, Secret, ConfigMap, Pod Volume, and Ingress. 

NOTE: It is strongly recommended to use kube-state-metrics version 2.0 or later in order to take advantage of the full feature set including the ability to link Kubernetes persistent volumes (PVs) to backend storage devices. Note also that with kube-state-metrics version 2.0 and above, Kubernetes object labels are not exported by default. To configure kube-state-metrics to export Kubernetes object labels, you must specify a metric labels "allow" list. Refer to the _--metric-labels-allowlist_ option in the link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/blob/master/docs/cli-arguments.md[kube-state-metrics documentation]. 


Use the following steps to install the kube-state-metrics server:

.Steps

. Create a temporary folder (for example, _/tmp/kube-state-yaml-files/_) and copy the .yaml files from https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/tree/master/examples/standard to this folder. 

. Run the following command to apply the .yaml files needed for installing kube-state-metrics:

 kubectl apply -f /tmp/kube-state-yaml-files/

==== Uninstalling the Agent

Note that these commands are using the default namespace "ci-monitoring".  If you have set your own namespace, substitute that namespace in these and all subsequent commands and files.

To uninstall the agent on Kubernetes, do the following:

If the monitoring namespace is being used solely for Telegraf:

 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete ds,rs,cm,sa,clusterrole,clusterrolebinding -l app=ci-telegraf
 
 kubectl delete ns ci-monitoring

For the commands above, use “_netapp-monitoring_” if you installed using operator-based installation.
 
If the monitoring namespace is being used for other purposes in addition to Telegraf:

 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete ds,rs,cm,sa,clusterrole,clusterrolebinding -l app=ci-telegraf

////
. Stop and delete the Telegraf service:

 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete ds telegraf-ds 
 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete rs telegraf-rs
 
. Delete the Telegraf ConfigMap and ServiceAccount:

 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete cm telegraf-conf 
 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete cm telegraf-conf-rs
 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete sa telegraf-user 
 
. Delete the Telegraf ClusterRole and ClusterRolebinding:

 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete clusterrole endpoint-access 
 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete clusterrolebinding endpoint-access 
////
 
==== Upgrading the Agent
[#upgrading-kubernetes-agent]

Note that these commands are using the default namespace "ci-monitoring".  If you have set your own namespace, substitute that namespace in these and all subsequent commands and files.

To upgrade the telegraf agent, do the following:

. Back up the existing configurations:

 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring get cm -o yaml > /tmp/telegraf-configs.yaml
 
 Be sure to specify the appropriate namespace if it is not the default.

. Uninstall the Agent (see above for instructions)

. link:#kubernetes[Install the new agent].

////
. Re-apply the configurations:

 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring apply -f /tmp/telegraf-conf.yaml --force
 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring apply -f /tmp/telegraf-conf-rs.yaml --force
 
. Restart all telegraf pods. Run the following command for each telegraf pod:

 kubectl --namespace ci-monitoring delete pod <Telegraf_pod>

== Verifying Checksums

The Cloud Insights agent installer performs integrity checks, but some users may want to perform their own verifications before installing or applying downloaded artifacts. To perform a download-only operation (as opposed to the default download-and-install), these users can edit the agent installation command obtained from the UI and remove the trailing “install” option.

Follow these steps:

. Copy the Agent Installer snippet as directed.
. Instead of pasting the snippet into a command window, paste it into a text editor.
. Remove the trailing “--install” (Linux/Mac) or “-install” (Windows) from the command.
. Copy the entire command from the text editor.
. Now paste it into your command window (in a working directory) and run it.

Non-Windows:

* Download and install (default):

 installerName=<installation_script_name> … && sudo -E -H ./$installerName --download –-install

* Download-only:

 installerName=<installation_script_name> … && sudo -E -H ./$installerName --download

Windows:

* Download and install (default):

 !$($installerName=".\cloudinsights-windows.ps1") … -and $(&$installerName -download -install)

*	Download-only:

 !$($installerName=".\cloudinsights-windows.ps1") … -and $(&$installerName -download)



The download-only command will download all required artifacts from Cloud Insights to the working directory.  The artifacts include, but may not be limited to: 

* an installation script
* an environment file
* YAML files
* a signed checksum file (sha256.signed)
* a PEM file (netapp_cert.pem) for signature verification



The installation script, environment file, and YAML files can be verified using visual inspection. 



The PEM file can be verified by confirming its fingerprint to be the following:

 E5:FB:7B:68:C0:8B:1C:A9:02:70:85:84:C2:74:F8:EF:C7:BE:8A:BC

More specifically,

*	Non-Windows:

 openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha1 -noout -inform pem -in netapp_cert.pem

*	Windows:

 Import-Certificate -Filepath .\netapp_cert.pem -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\Root




The signed checksum file can be verified using the PEM file:

*	Non-Windows:

 openssl smime -verify -in sha256.signed -CAfile netapp_cert.pem -purpose any

*	Windows (after installing the certificate via Import-Certificate above):

 Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath .\sha256.ps1 $result = Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath .\sha256.ps1 $signer = $result.SignerCertificate Add-Type -Assembly System.Security [Security.Cryptography.x509Certificates.X509Certificate2UI]::DisplayCertificate($signer)



Once all of the artifacts have been satisfactorily verified, the agent installation can be initiated by running:

Non-Windows:

 sudo -E -H ./<installation_script_name> --install

Windows:

 .\ cloudinsights-windows.ps1 -install
 



== Troubleshooting Agent Installation

Some things to try if you encounter problems setting up an agent:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:

|I already installed an agent using Cloud Insights| If you have already installed an agent on your host/VM, you do not need to install the agent again. In this case, simply choose the appropriate Platform and Key in the Agent Installation screen, and click on *Continue* or *Finish*. 

|I already have an agent installed but not by using the Cloud Insights installer|Remove the previous agent and run the Cloud Insights Agent installation, to ensure proper default configuration file settings. When complete, click on *Continue* or *Finish*.

|I do not see a hyperlink/connection between my Kubernetes Persistent Volume and the corresponding back-end storage device. My Kubernetes Persistent Volume is configured using the hostname of the storage server.|Follow the steps to uninstall the existing Telegraf agent, then re-install the latest Telegraf agent.

|I'm seeing messages in the logs resembling the following:

E0901 15:21:39.962145 1 reflector.go:178] k8s.io/kube-state-metrics/internal/store/builder.go:352: Failed to list *v1.MutatingWebhookConfiguration: the server could not find the requested resource
E0901 15:21:43.168161 1 reflector.go:178] k8s.io/kube-state-metrics/internal/store/builder.go:352: Failed to list *v1.Lease: the server could not find the requested resource (get leases.coordination.k8s.io)
etc.

|These messages may occur if your kube-state-metrics version is higher than your Kubernetes version. For example, running kube-state-metrics version 2.0.0 or above with Kubernetes version 1.17. 

to get the Kubernetes version:

_kubectl version_

to get the kube-state-metrics version:

_kubectl get deploy/kube-state-metrics -o jsonpath='{..image}'_

To prevent these messages from happening, users can modify their kube-state-metrics deployment to disable the leases _mutatingwebhookconfigurations_, _validatingwebhookconfigurations_, and _volumeattachments resources_. More specifically, they can use the following CLI argument:

resources=certificatesigningrequests,configmaps,cronjobs,daemonsets,deployments,endpoints,horizontalpodautoscalers,ingresses,jobs,limitranges,namespaces,networkpolicies,nodes,persistentvolumeclaims,persistentvolumes,poddisruptionbudgets,pods,replicasets,replicationcontrollers,resourcequotas,secrets,services,statefulsets,storageclasses

The default resource list is:

"certificatesigningrequests,configmaps,cronjobs,daemonsets,deployments,endpoints,horizontalpodautoscalers,ingresses,jobs,leases,limitranges,mutatingwebhookconfigurations,namespaces,networkpolicies,nodes,persistentvolumeclaims,persistentvolumes,poddisruptionbudgets,pods,replicasets,replicationcontrollers,resourcequotas,secrets,services,statefulsets,storageclasses,validatingwebhookconfigurations,volumeattachments"
