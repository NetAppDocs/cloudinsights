*This Topic Is Under Construction*

Telegraf is a plugin-driven server agent that can be used to collect and report metrics, events, and logs. Input plugins are used to collect the desired information into Telegraf by accessing the system/OS directly, by calling third-party APIs, or by listening to configured streams (i.e. Kafka, statsD, etc). Output plugins are used to send the collected metric, events, and logs from Telegraf to Cloud Insights. 

This topic provides instructions for installing Telegraf on the following operating systems:

* Windows
* RHEL / CentOS
* Ubuntu / Debian
* MacOS
* Kubernetes

== Installing an Agent

=== Install Telegraf on Windows
These steps are performed from the UI instructions.

To complete the installation of Telegraph on Windows, you install the Telegraf software and customize the configuration file. 

.Steps to install Telegraph:

////
. Create the the following directory:  C:\Program Files\Telegraf 
+ 
When you install in a different location, specify the -config parameter with the new location. 

. Place the Telegraf.exe and the Telegraf.conf files into C:\Program Files\Telegraf.

. Edit the configuration file to meet your requirements.

. Verify that Telegraph is working properly:
+ 
C: \"Program Files"\Telegraf\telegraf.exe --config C: \"Program Files"\Telegraf\telegraf.conf --test
////

After the Agent is installed, you can use the following commands to perform telegraf functions:

* Install telegraf as a service: 
+
telegraf.exe --service install	

* Remove the telegraf service
+
telegraf.exe --service uninstall

* Start the telegraf service
+
telegraf.exe --service start	

* Stop the telegraf service
+ 
telegraf.exe --service stop

=== Install Telegraf on RHEL and CentOS

.Steps to install Telegraph:

image:AgentInstallRHELCentOS.png[Red Hat/CentOS Agent Install]

////
. Install the latest stable version of Telegraf using the yum package manager:
+
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/influxdb.repo
  [influxdb]
  name = InfluxDB Repository - RHEL \$releasever
  baseurl = https://repos.influxdata.com/rhel/\$releasever/\$basearch/stable
  enabled = 1
  gpgcheck = 1
  gpgkey = https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key
  EOF
  
. Once repository is added to the yum configuration, install and start the Telegraf service:
+ 
sudo yum install telegraf
sudo service telegraf start

. If your operating system is using systemd (CentOS 7+ and RHEL 7+)
+
sudo yum install telegraf
sudo systemctl start telegraf
////

After the agent is installed, you can use the following commands to start/stop the service:

* sudo service telegraf start
* sudo service telegraf stop

. If your operating system is using systemd (CentOS 7+ and RHEL 7+)

* sudo systemctl start telegraf
* sudo systemctl stop telegraf

==== RHEL and CentOS Configuration

To create a configuration file with default input and output plugins. Every plugin is included in this file, but most are commented out:

telegraf config > telegraf.conf

To create a configuration file with specific inputs and outputs: 

telegraf --input-filter <pluginname>[:<pluginname>] --output-filter <outputname>[:<outputname>] config > telegraf.conf


=== Install Telegraf on Debian and Ubuntu

|===
|Problem:|Try this:
|I already have an agent in my environment| If you have already installed an agent on your host/VM, you do not need to install the agent again. In this case, simply choose the appropriate Platform and Key in the Agent Installation screen, and click on *Continue*. |
