Cloud Insights uses link:https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1.9/[Telegraf] as its agent for collection of integration data. Telegraf is a plugin-driven server agent that can be used to collect and report metrics, events, and logs. Input plugins are used to collect the desired information into the agent by accessing the system/OS directly, by calling third-party APIs, or by listening to configured streams (i.e. Kafka, statsD, etc). Output plugins are used to send the collected metric, events, and logs from the agent to Cloud Insights. 

//NOTE: This topic is considered Preview documentation and is subject to change.

== Installing an Agent

This topic provides instructions for installing the Telegraf agent on the following platforms:

* <<Windows>>
* <<RHEL and CentOS>>
* <<Ubuntu and Debian>>
* <<macOS>>
* <<Kubernetes>>

To install an agent, regardless of the platform you are using, you must first do the following:

. Log into the host you will use for your agent. 
. Log in to your Cloud Insights site and go to *Admin > Data Collectors*.
. Click on *+Data Collector* and choose a data collector to install. There are several types of data collectors:
+
* *Host* (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)
+
* *Service* (integration with a wide variety of agent-collected plugins). Agents are configured and run as a service for RHEL/CentOS, Ubuntu/Debian, macOS, and Windows. For Kubernetes platforms, the agent in configured as a DaemonSet.
+
* *Infrastructure* (collects from storage, switch, cloud platform, etc.). Infrastructure collection is done with an link:task_configure_acquisition_unit.html[Acquisition Unit] instead of an Agent.

. Choose the appropriate platform for your host (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)
. Follow the remaining steps for each platform below

NOTE: Once you have installed an agent on a host, you do not need to install an agent again on that host. 

TIP: Once you have installed an agent on a server/VM, Cloud Insights collects metrics from that system in addition to collecting from any data collectors you configure. These metrics are gathered as link:task_config_telegraf_node.html["Node" metrics].

=== Windows

image:AgentInstallKubernetes.png[Kubernetes Agent Install]

.Pre-requisites:

* The following commands must be available: curl and sudo

.Steps to install agent on Kubernetes:

. If prompted, select Kubernetes from the Platform drop-down.
. Choose an Agent Access Key.

After the agent is installed, generate the Telegraf DaemonSet YAML and ReplicaSet YAML:

 kubectl --namespace monitoring get ds telegraf-ds -o yaml > /tmp/telegraf-ds.yaml 
 kubectl --namespace monitoring get rs telegraf-rs -o yaml > /tmp/telegraf-rs.yaml

You can use the following commands to stop and start the Telegraf service:

 kubectl --namespace monitoring delete ds telegraf-ds
 kubectl --namespace monitoring delete ds telegraf-rs
 
 kubectl --namespace monitoring apply -f /tmp/telegraf-ds.yaml 
 kubectl --namespace monitoring apply -f /tmp/telegraf-rs.yaml
 
==== Configuring the Agent to Collect Data from Kubernetes

For Kubernetes environments, Cloud Insights deploys the Telegraf agent as a DaemonSet and a ReplicaSet. The pods in which the agents run need to have access to the following:

* hostPath
* configMap
* secrets

These Kubernetes objects are automatically created as part of the Kubernetes agent install command provided in the Cloud Insights UI. Some variants of Kubernetes, such as OpenShift, implement an added level of security that may block access to these components. The _SecurityContextConstraint_ is not created as part of the Kubernetes agent install command provided in the Cloud Insights UI, and must be created manually. Once created, restart the Telegraf pod(s).

//In such cases, an additional manual step may be required.  As an example, for OpenShift, you may need to create a _SecurityContextConstraint_ to grant the telegraf-user ServiceAccount access to these components.

Use the following steps to install the kube-state-metrics server:

.Steps

. Create a temporary folder (for example, _/tmp/kube-state-yaml-files/_) and copy the .yaml files from https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-state-metrics/tree/master/kubernetes to this folder.

==== Uninstalling the Agent

To uninstall the agent on Kubernetes, do the following:

If the monitoring namespace is being used solely for Telegraf:

 kubectl delete ns monitoring
 
If the monitoring namespace is being used for other purposes in addition to Telegraf:

Stop and delete the Telegraf service:

 kubectl --namespace monitoring delete ds telegraf-ds 
 kubectl --namespace monitoring delete rs telegraf-rs
 
Delete the Telegraf ConfigMap and ServiceAccount:

 kubectl --namespace monitoring delete cm telegraf-conf 
 kubectl --namespace monitoring delete cm telegraf-conf-rs
 kubectl --namespace monitoring delete sa telegraf-user 
 
Delete the Telegraf ClusterRole and ClusterRolebinding:

 kubectl --namespace monitoring delete clusterrole endpoint-access 
 kubectl --namespace monitoring delete clusterrolebinding endpoint-access 
 

== Troubleshooting Agent Installation

Some things to try if you encounter problems setting up an agent:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:
|I already installed an agent using Cloud Insights| If you have already installed an agent on your host/VM, you do not need to install the agent again. In this case, simply choose the appropriate Platform and Key in the Agent Installation screen, and click on *Continue* or *Finish*. 
|I already have an agent installed but not by using the Cloud Insights installer|Remove the previous agent and run the Cloud Insights Agent installation, to ensure proper default configuration file settings. When complete, click on *Continue* or *Finish*.
