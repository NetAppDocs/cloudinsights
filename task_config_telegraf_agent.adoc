Cloud Insights uses link:https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf[Telegraf] as its agent for collection of integration data. Telegraf is a plugin-driven server agent that can be used to collect and report metrics, events, and logs. Input plugins are used to collect the desired information into the agent by accessing the system/OS directly, by calling third-party APIs, or by listening to configured streams (i.e. Kafka, statsD, etc). Output plugins are used to send the collected metrics, events, and logs from the agent to Cloud Insights. 

The current Telegraf version for Cloud Insights is *1.22.3*.

NOTE: For accurate audit and data reporting, it is strongly recommended to synchronize the time on the Agent machine using *Network Time Protocol (NTP)* or *Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)*.

NOTE: If you want to verify the installation files before instaling the Agent, see the section below on <<Verifying Checksums>>.

== Installing an Agent

If you are installing a Service data collector and have not yet configured an Agent, you are prompted to first install an Agent for the appropriate Operating System. This topic provides instructions for installing the Telegraf agent on the following Operating Systems:

* <<Windows>>
* <<RHEL and CentOS>>
* <<Ubuntu and Debian>>
* <<macOS>>
* <<Kubernetes>>

To install an agent, regardless of the platform you are using, you must first do the following:

. Log into the host you will use for your agent. 
. Log in to your Cloud Insights site and go to *Admin > Data Collectors*.
. Click on *+Data Collector* and choose a data collector to install. 
////
There are several types of data collectors:
+
* *Host* (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)
+
* *Service* (integration with a wide variety of agent-collected plugins). Agents are configured and run as a service for RHEL/CentOS, Ubuntu/Debian, macOS, and Windows. For Kubernetes platforms, the agent in configured as a DaemonSet.
+
* *Infrastructure* (collects from storage, switch, cloud platform, etc.). Infrastructure collection is done with an link:task_configure_acquisition_unit.html[Acquisition Unit] instead of an Agent.
////
. Choose the appropriate platform for your host (Windows, Linux, macOS, etc.)
. Follow the remaining steps for each platform.

NOTE: Once you have installed an agent on a host, you do not need to install an agent again on that host. 

TIP: Once you have installed an agent on a server/VM, Cloud Insights collects metrics from that system in addition to collecting from any data collectors you configure. These metrics are gathered as link:task_config_telegraf_node.html["Node" metrics].

NOTE: If you are using a proxy, read the proxy instructions for your platform before installing the Telegraf agent.

=== Windows

==== Pre-requisites:

* PowerShell must be installed
* If you are behind a proxy, you must follow the instructions in the *Configuring Proxy Support for Windows* section.

[#kubernetes]
== Kubernetes

The NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator (NKMO) is the preferred method for installing Kubernetes for Cloud Insights Insights, for more flexible configuration of monitoring in fewer steps, as well as enhanced opportunities for monitoring other software running in the K8s cluster.
+
Please link:task_config_telegraf_agent_k8s.html[*go here*] for information and installation instructions for the NetApp Kubernetes Monitoring Operator.





== Verifying Checksums

The Cloud Insights agent installer performs integrity checks, but some users may want to perform their own verifications before installing or applying downloaded artifacts. To perform a download-only operation (as opposed to the default download-and-install), these users can edit the agent installation command obtained from the UI and remove the trailing “install” option.

Follow these steps:

. Copy the Agent Installer snippet as directed.
. Instead of pasting the snippet into a command window, paste it into a text editor.
. Remove the trailing “--install” (Linux/Mac) or “-install” (Windows) from the command.
. Copy the entire command from the text editor.
. Now paste it into your command window (in a working directory) and run it.

Non-Windows (these examples are for Kubernetes; actual script names may vary):

* Download and install (default):

 installerName=cloudinsights-kubernetes.sh … && sudo -E -H ./$installerName --download –-install

* Download-only:

 installerName=cloudinsights-kubernetes.sh … && sudo -E -H ./$installerName --download

Windows:

* Download and install (default):

 !$($installerName=".\cloudinsights-windows.ps1") … -and $(&$installerName -download -install)

*	Download-only:

 !$($installerName=".\cloudinsights-windows.ps1") … -and $(&$installerName -download)



The download-only command will download all required artifacts from Cloud Insights to the working directory.  The artifacts include, but may not be limited to: 

* an installation script
* an environment file
* YAML files
* a signed checksum file (sha256.signed)
* a PEM file (netapp_cert.pem) for signature verification



The installation script, environment file, and YAML files can be verified using visual inspection. 



The PEM file can be verified by confirming its fingerprint to be the following:

 E5:FB:7B:68:C0:8B:1C:A9:02:70:85:84:C2:74:F8:EF:C7:BE:8A:BC

More specifically,

*	Non-Windows:

 openssl x509 -fingerprint -sha1 -noout -inform pem -in netapp_cert.pem

*	Windows:

 Import-Certificate -Filepath .\netapp_cert.pem -CertStoreLocation Cert:\CurrentUser\Root




The signed checksum file can be verified using the PEM file:

*	Non-Windows:

 openssl smime -verify -in sha256.signed -CAfile netapp_cert.pem -purpose any

*	Windows (after installing the certificate via Import-Certificate above):

 Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath .\sha256.ps1 $result = Get-AuthenticodeSignature -FilePath .\sha256.ps1 $signer = $result.SignerCertificate Add-Type -Assembly System.Security [Security.Cryptography.x509Certificates.X509Certificate2UI]::DisplayCertificate($signer)



Once all of the artifacts have been satisfactorily verified, the agent installation can be initiated by running:

Non-Windows:

 sudo -E -H ./<installation_script_name> --install

Windows:

 .\cloudinsights-windows.ps1 -install
 



== Troubleshooting Agent Installation

Some things to try if you encounter problems setting up an agent:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:

|I already installed an agent using Cloud Insights| If you have already installed an agent on your host/VM, you do not need to install the agent again. In this case, simply choose the appropriate Platform and Key in the Agent Installation screen, and click on *Continue* or *Finish*. 

|I already have an agent installed but not by using the Cloud Insights installer|Remove the previous agent and run the Cloud Insights Agent installation, to ensure proper default configuration file settings. When complete, click on *Continue* or *Finish*.

|I do not see a hyperlink/connection between my Kubernetes Persistent Volume and the corresponding back-end storage device. My Kubernetes Persistent Volume is configured using the hostname of the storage server.
|Follow the steps to uninstall the existing Telegraf agent, then re-install the latest Telegraf agent. You must be using Telegraf version 2.0 or later.

|I'm seeing messages in the logs resembling the following:

E0901 15:21:39.962145 1 reflector.go:178] k8s.io/kube-state-metrics/internal/store/builder.go:352: Failed to list *v1.MutatingWebhookConfiguration: the server could not find the requested resource

etc.


|These messages may occur if you are running kube-state-metrics version 2.0.0 or above with Kubernetes version 1.17 or below.


To get the Kubernetes version:

 _kubectl version_

To get the kube-state-metrics version:

 _kubectl get deploy/kube-state-metrics -o jsonpath='{..image}'_

To prevent these messages from happening, users can modify their kube-state-metrics deployment to disable the following Leases:

_mutatingwebhookconfigurations_
_validatingwebhookconfigurations_
_volumeattachments resources_

More specifically, they can use the following CLI argument:

resources=certificatesigningrequests,configmaps,cronjobs,daemonsets, deployments,endpoints,horizontalpodautoscalers,ingresses,jobs,limitranges, namespaces,networkpolicies,nodes,persistentvolumeclaims,persistentvolumes, poddisruptionbudgets,pods,replicasets,replicationcontrollers,resourcequotas, secrets,services,statefulsets,storageclasses

The default resource list is:

|I installed or upgraded Telegraf on Kubernetes, but the Telegraf pods are not starting up.  The Telegraf ReplicaSet or DaemonSet is reporting a failure resembling the following:

 Error creating: pods "telegraf-rs-" is forbidden": unable to validate against any security context constraint: [spec.volumes[2]: Invalid value: "hostPath": hostPath volumes are not allowed to be used]

|Create a Security Context Constraint (refer to the Configuring the Agent to Collect Data from Kubernetes section above) if one does not already exist.

Ensure the namespace and service account specified for the Security Context Constraint matches the namespace and service account for the Telegraf ReplicaSet and DaemonSet.

 kubectl describe scc telegraf-hostaccess \|grep serviceaccount

|This is a known issue.  Refer to link:https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/issues/9407[This GitHub article] for more details. As long as Telegraf is up and running, users can ignore these error messages.

|On Kubernetes, my Telegraf pod(s) are reporting the following error:
"Error in processing mountstats info: failed to open mountstats file: /hostfs/proc/1/mountstats, error: open /hostfs/proc/1/mountstats: permission denied"
|If SELinux is enabled and enforcing, it is likely preventing the Telegraf pod(s) from accessing the /proc/1/mountstats file on the Kubernetes nodes.  To relax this restriction, do ONE of the following:

• For script-based installations, edit the telegraf DS (`kubectl edit ds telegraf-ds`), and change "privileged: false" to "privileged: true"
• For operator-based installation, edit the agent (`kubectl edit agent agent-monitoring-netapp`), and change "privileged-mode: false" to "privileged-mode: true"


|On Kubernetes, my Telegraf ReplicaSet pod is reporting the following error:

 [inputs.prometheus] Error in plugin: could not load keypair /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt:/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key: open /etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt: no such file or directory
|The Telegraf ReplicaSet pod is intended to run on a node designated as a master or for etcd. If the ReplicaSet pod is not running on one of these nodes, you will get these errors. Check to see if your master/etcd nodes have taints on them. If they do, add the necessary tolerations to the Telegraf ReplicaSet, telegraf-rs.

For example, edit the ReplicaSet...

 kubectl edit rs telegraf-rs

...and add the appropriate tolerations to the spec. Then, restart the ReplicaSet pod.
