*This Topic Is Under Construction*

The Cloud Insights Agent is a plugin-driven server agent that can be used to collect and report metrics, events, and logs. Input plugins are used to collect the desired information into the agent by accessing the system/OS directly, by calling third-party APIs, or by listening to configured streams (i.e. Kafka, statsD, etc). Output plugins are used to send the collected metric, events, and logs from the agent to Cloud Insights. 


== Installing an Agent

This topic provides instructions for installing the Cloud Insights Agent on the following platforms:

* Windows
* RHEL or CentOS
* Ubuntu or Debian
* MacOS
* Kubernetes

To install a Cloud Insights agent, regardless of the platform you are using, you must first do the following:

. Log into the host you will use for your Agent. 
. Log in to your Cloud Insights site and go to *Admin > Data Collectors*.
. Click on *+Data Collector* and choose a data collector to install. There are several types of data collectors:
+
* *Host* (Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc.)
+
* *Service* (integration with a wide variety of agent-collected plugins)
+
* *Infrastructure* (collects from storage, switch, cloud platform, etc.). Infrastructure collection is done with an link:task_configure_acquisition_unit.html[Acquisition Unit] instead of an Agent.

. Choose the appropriate platform for your host (Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc.)
. Follow the remaining steps for each platform below

NOTE: Once you have installed an agent on a host, you do not need to install an agent again on that host. 


=== Windows
To install the agent on a Windows host, you first install the agent software and then customize the configuration file. 

image:AgentInstallWindows.png[Windows Agent Install]

.Pre-requisites:

* PowerShell must be installed, and you must have Administrative permissions for the PowerShell command
* At least one Agent Access Key configured

.Steps to install agent on Windows:

. Select Windows from the Platform drop-down.
. Choose an Agent Access Key.
. If you have not already installed an agent on this host:
.. Copy the command block from the agent installation dialog. You can click the clipboard icon to quickly copy the command to the clipboard.
.. Open a PowerShell window as administrator
.. Paste the command into the PowerShell window and press Enter.
.. The command will download the appropriate agent installer, install it, and set a default configuration. When finished, it will restart the agent service.
. In you have already installed an agent on this host, you can skip the previous step
. Click *Finish* or *Continue*



////
. Create the the following directory:  C:\Program Files\Telegraf 
+ 
When you install in a different location, specify the -config parameter with the new location. 

. Place the Telegraf.exe and the Telegraf.conf files into C:\Program Files\Telegraf.

. Edit the configuration file to meet your requirements.

. Verify that Telegraph is working properly:
+ 
C: \"Program Files"\Telegraf\telegraf.exe --config C: \"Program Files"\Telegraf\telegraf.conf --test
////

After the Agent is installed, you can use the following commands to perform telegraf functions:

////
* Install telegraf as a service: 
+
telegraf.exe --service install	

* Remove the telegraf service
+
telegraf.exe --service uninstall
////

After the agent is installed, you can use the following commands to start/stop the service:

* telegraf.exe --service start	
* telegraf.exe --service stop


=== Install Telegraf on RHEL and CentOS

.Steps to install Telegraph:

image:AgentInstallRHELCentOS.png[Red Hat/CentOS Agent Install]

////
. Install the latest stable version of Telegraf using the yum package manager:
+
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/influxdb.repo
  [influxdb]
  name = InfluxDB Repository - RHEL \$releasever
  baseurl = https://repos.influxdata.com/rhel/\$releasever/\$basearch/stable
  enabled = 1
  gpgcheck = 1
  gpgkey = https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key
  EOF
  
. Once repository is added to the yum configuration, install and start the Telegraf service:
+ 
sudo yum install telegraf
sudo service telegraf start

. If your operating system is using systemd (CentOS 7+ and RHEL 7+)
+
sudo yum install telegraf
sudo systemctl start telegraf
////

After the agent is installed, you can use the following commands to start/stop the service:

* sudo service telegraf start
* sudo service telegraf stop

If your operating system is using systemd (CentOS 7+ and RHEL 7+):

* sudo systemctl start telegraf
* sudo systemctl stop telegraf

==== RHEL and CentOS Configuration

To create a configuration file with default input and output plugins, run the following command. Every plugin is included in this file, but most are commented out:

telegraf config > telegraf.conf

To create a configuration file with specific inputs and outputs: 

telegraf --input-filter <pluginname>[:<pluginname>] --output-filter <outputname>[:<outputname>] config > telegraf.conf


=== Install Telegraf on Debian and Ubuntu

|Problem:|Try this:
|I already have an agent in my environment| If you have already installed an agent on your host/VM, you do not need to install the agent again. In this case, simply choose the appropriate Platform and Key in the Agent Installation screen, and click on *Continue* or *Finish*. |
