The Hitachi Vantara NAS data collector is an inventory and configuration data collector that  supports discovery of HDS NAS clusters. Data Infrastructure Insights supports discovering NFS and CIFS shares, file systems (Internal Volumes), and spans (Storage Pools).

== Terminology

Data Infrastructure Insights acquires the following inventory information from the HNAS data collector. For each asset type acquired by Data Infrastructure Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collector. 

== Requirements 

* Device IP address
* Port 22, SSH protocol
* Username and password - privilege level: Supervisor
* Note: This data collector is SSH based, so the AU that hosts it must be able to initiate  SSH sessions to TCP 22 on the HNAS itself, or the Systems Management Unit (SMU) that the cluster is connected to.

|"Error connecting " or “Invalid login credentials" with error messages “Could not communicate with the device:"
|* Check IP address
* Check user name and password
* Confirm connection with alternate SSH client
