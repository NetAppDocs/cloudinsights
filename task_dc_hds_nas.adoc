= Configuring the HDS NAS (HNAS) data collector

[.lead] 

The HDS NAS (HNAS) data collector is an inventory and configuration data collector that  supports discovery of HDS NAS clusters. Cloud Insights supports discovering NFS and CIFS shares, file systems (Internal Volumes), and spans (Storage Pools).

== Terminology

Cloud Insights acquires the following inventory information from the HNAS data collector. For each asset type acquired by Cloud Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Vendor/Model Term|Cloud Insights Term 
|Tier|Disk Group
|Cluster|Storage
|Node|Storage Node
|Span|Storage Pool
|System Drive|Backend Lun
|Files System|Internal Volume
|===

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collector. 

== Requirements 

* Device IP address
* Port 22, SSH protocol
* Username and password - privilege level: Supervisor
* Note: This data collector is SSH based, so the AU that hosts it must be able to initiate  SSH sessions to TCP 22 on the HNAS itself, or the Systems Management Unit (SMU) that the cluster is connected to.


== Configuration

|Field|Description 
|HNAS Host|IP address or fully-qualified domain name of HNAS Management Host
|User Name|User name for HNAS CLI
|Password|Password used for HNAS CLI

== Advanced configuration

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]

|Field|Description 
|Inventory Poll Interval (min)|Interval between inventory polls. The default is 30 minutes. 
//|SSH Banner Wait Timeout (sec)|SSH banner wait timeout. The default is 15 seconds.
//|SSH Command Timeout (sec)|SSH command timeout. The default is 30 seconds.

|Problem:|Try this:
|"Error connecting" with error messages “Error setting up shell channel:”or “Error opening shell channel”
|Likely caused by network connectivity issues or SSH is misconfigured. Confirm connection with alternate SSH client
|"Timeout" or “Error retrieving data" with error messages “Command: XXX has timed out."
|* Try the command with alternate SSH client
* Increase timeout
|"Error connecting " or “Invalid login credentials" with error messages “Could not communicate with the device:"
|* Check IP address
* Check user name and password
* Confirm connection with alternate SSH client
