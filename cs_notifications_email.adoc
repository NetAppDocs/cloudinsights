To configure Cloud Secure alert recipients, click on *Admin > Notifications* and enter an email addresses in the appropriate section(s) for each recipient.

=== Potential Attack Alerts and Warnings

To send _Potential Attack_ alert notifications, enter the recipients' email addresses in the _Send Potential Attack Alerts_ section. 
Email notifications are sent to the alert recipient list for every action on the alert.

To send _Warning_ notifications, enter the recipients' email addresses in the _Send Warning Alerts_ section.

=== Agent and Data Collector Health monitoring

You can monitor the health of Agents and Data Sources through notifications.

In order to receive notifications in the event that an Agent or Data Source collector is not functioning, enter the email addresses of the recipients in the _Data Collection Health Alerts_ section.

Keep the following in mind:

* Health alerts will be sent only after the agent/collector stops reporting for at least one hour.
* Only one email notification is sent to the intended recipients in a given 24 hour period, even If the Agent or Data collector is disconnected for a longer duration.
* In case of an Agent failure, one alert will be sent (not one per collector). The email will include a list of all impacted SVMs.
* Active directory collection failure is reported as a warning; it does not impact Ransomware detection.
* The Getting Started setup list now includes a new _Configure email notifications_ phase.
