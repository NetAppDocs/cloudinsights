This data collector supports inventory and performance collection from Google Compute cloud platform configurations. This collector will seek to discover all the Compute resources within all the Projects within one Google organization. If you have multiple Google organizations you want to discover with Data Infrastructure Insights, you will want to deploy one Data Infrastructure Insights collector per organization.
