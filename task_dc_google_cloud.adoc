This data collector supports inventory and performance collection from Google Compute cloud platform configurations. This collector will seek to discover all the Compute resources within all the Projects within one Google organization. If you have multiple Google organizations you want to discover with Data Infrastructure Insights, you will want to deploy one Data Infrastructure Insights collector per organization. 

== Service Account Requirements

* You must create a service account by following the instructions in link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts[Creating/Managing Service Accounts]. Such service account is identified by a unique ID, known as its _clientId_, which will be used as a username. 
* Additionally, create a service account key by following the instructions in link:https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys[Creating/Managing Service Account Keys]. This key can be downloaded as a json file, whose content will be used as a password.
* The service account must be scoped for _compute.readonly_, _monitoring.read_, and _cloud-platform_.
