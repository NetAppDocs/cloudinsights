Cloud Insights can differentiate between a storage array having local storage or virtualization of other storage arrays. This gives you the ability to relate cost and distinguish performance from the front-end all the way to the back-end of your infrastructure.

=== Virtualization in a Table Widget

One of the easiest ways to begin looking at your storage virtualization is to create a dashboard table widget showing Virtualized type. When building the query for the widget, simply add "virtualizedType" to your grouping or filter.

The resulting table widget shows you the _Standard_, _Backend_, and _Virtual_ storages in your environment.

=== Storage Landing Page

On a Storage landing page, you can see relevant virtualization information. For example, looking at a Virtual storage landing page, you can see that this is a Virtual storage, and which backend storage system applies.
