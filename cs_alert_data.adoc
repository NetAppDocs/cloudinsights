[.lead]
The Workload Security Alerts page shows a timeline of recent attacks and/or warnings and allows you to view details for each issue. 

NOTE: Workload Security is not available in Cloud Insights Federal Edition.

////
The Alerts page shows all alerts generated by Workload Security. 

Use this page to identify recent alerts and the users generating those alerts. 

You can also access all alerts that have been raised with the ability to drill down into individual alerts. 
////

////
== History

History shows the number of alerts that have been raised over the last seven days. Hovering over the severity of the alerts displays the number, severity, and occurrence date for each alert type.  

== Notable Users 

* Shows a list of the users that have generated the highest number of alerts.

* Shows the type of alerts generated.

* Shows the total number of alerts generated for each user. 
////

== Alert

The Alert list displays a graph showing the total number of Potential Attacks and/or Warnings that have been raised in the selected time range, followed by a list of the attacks and/or warnings that occurred in that time range. You can change the time range by adjusting the start time and end time sliders in the graph.

The following is displayed for each alert:

*Potential Attacks:* 

* The _Potential Attack_ type (for example, Ransomware or Sabotage)

* The date and time the potential attack was _Detected_

* The _Status_ of the alert:

** *New*: This is the default for new alerts.
** *In Progress*: The alert is under investigation by a team member or members.
** *Resolved*: The alert has been marked as resolved by a team member.
** *Dismissed*: The alert has been dismissed as false positive or expected behavior.
+
An administrator can change the status of the alert and add a note to assist with investigation.

* The _User_ whose behavior triggered the alert

* _Evidence_ of the attack (for example, a large number of files was encrypted)

* The _Action Taken_ (for example, a snapshot was taken)


*Warnings:*

* The _Abnormal Behavior_ that triggered the warning

* The date and time the behavior was _Detected_

* The _Status_ of the alert (New, In progress, etc.)

* The _User_ whose behavior triggered the alert

* A description of the _Change_ (for example, an abnormal increase in file access)

* The _Action Taken_



== Filter Options 

You can filter Alerts by the following:

* The _Status_ of the alert
* Specific text in the _Note_
* The type of _Attacks/Warnings_
* The _User_ whose actions triggered the alert/warning


== The Alert Details page

You can click an alert link on the Alerts list page to open a detail page for the alert. Alert details may vary according to the type of attack or alert. For example, a Ransomware Attack detail page may show the following information:

=== Summary section:

* Attack type (Ransomware, Sabotage) and Alert ID (assigned by Workload Security)
* Date and Time the attack was detected
* Action Taken (for example, an automatic snapshot was taken. Time of snapshot is shown immediately below the summary section))
* Status (New, In Progress, etc.)

=== Attack Results section:

* Counts of Affected Volumes and Files
* An accompanying summary of the detection
* A graph showing file activity during the attack

=== Related Users section:

This section shows details about the user involved in the potential attack, including a graph of Top Activity for the user.

== _Take a Snapshot_ Action

Workload Security protects your data by automatically taking a snapshot when malicious activity is detected, ensuring that your data is safely backed up.

You can define link:cs_automated_response_policies.html[automated response policies] that take a snapshot when ransomware attack or other abnormal user activity is detected.
You can also take a snapshot manually from the alert page.

Automatic Snapshot taken:

Manual Snapshot:

== Alert Notifications

Email notifications of alerts are sent to an alert recipient list for every action on the alert. To configure alert recipients, click on *Admin > Notifications* and enter an email addresses for each recipient.

== Retention Policy
Alerts and Warnings are retained for 13 months. Alerts and Warnings older than 13 months will be deleted.
If the Workload Security environment is deleted, all data associated with the environment is also deleted.

== Troubleshooting

|===
|Problem:|Try This:

|For snapshots taken by Workload Security (CS), is there a purging/archiving period for CS snapshots?
|No. There is no purging/archiving period set for CS snapshots. The user needs to define purging policy for CS snapshots. Please refer to the link:https://library.netapp.com/ecmdocs/ECMP1196819/html/GUID-27D0E37F-5AF1-4AF9-BDEB-9A4B7AF3B4A9.html[ONTAP documentation] on how to setup the policies.

|There is a situation where, ONTAP takes hourly snapshots per day. Will Workload Security (CS) snapshots affect it? Will CS snapshot take the hourly snapshot place? Will the default hourly snapshot get stopped?
|Workload Security snapshots will not affect the hourly snapshots. CS snapshots will not take the hourly snapshot space and that should continue as before. The default hourly snapshot will not get stopped.

|What will happen if the maximum snapshot count is reached in ONTAP?
|If the maximum Snapshot count is reached, subsequent Snapshot taking will fail and Workload Security will show an error message noting that Snapshot is full.
User needs to define Snapshot policies to delete the oldest snapshots, otherwise snapshots will not be taken.
In ONTAP 9.3 and earlier, a volume can contain up to 255 Snapshot copies. In ONTAP 9.4 and later, a volume can contain up to 1023 Snapshot copies.

See the ONTAP Documentation for information on link:https://docs.netapp.com/ontap-9/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.netapp.doc.dot-cm-cmpr-960%2Fvolume__snapshot__autodelete__modify.html[setting Snapshot deletion policy].


|Workload Security is unable to take snapshots at all.
|Make sure that the role being used to create snapshots has link: https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/task_add_collector_svm.html#a-note-about-permissions[proper rights assigned].
Make sure _csrole_ is created with proper access rights for taking snapshots:

 security login role create -vserver <vservername> -role csrole -cmddirname "volume snapshot" -access all

|Snapshots are failing for older alerts on SVMs which were removed from Workload Security and subsequently added back again. For new alerts which occur after SVM is added again, snapshots are taken.
|This is a rare scenario. In the event you experience this, log in to ONTAP and take the snapshots manually for the older alerts.

|In the _Alert Details_ page, the message “Last attempt failed” error is seen below the _Take Snapshot_ button.
Hovering over the error displays “Invoke API command has timed out for the data collector with id”.
|This can happen when a data collector is added to Workload Security via SVM Management IP, if the LIF of the SVM is in _disabled_ state in ONTAP.
Enable the particular LIF in ONTAP and trigger _Take Snapshot manually_ from Workload Security. The Snapshot action will then succeed.
