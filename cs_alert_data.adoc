== _Take a Snapshot_ Action

Cloud Secure protects your data by automatically taking a snapshot when malicious activity is detected, ensuring that your data is safely backed up.

You can define link:cs_automated_response_policies.html[automated response policies] that take a snapshot when ransomware attack or other abnormal user activity is detected.
You can also take a snapshot manually from the alert page.
