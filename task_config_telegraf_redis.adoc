Data Infrastructure Insights uses this data collector to gather metrics from Redis. Redis is an open source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker, supporting the following data structures: strings, hashes, lists, sets, and more. 

== Installation 

. From *Observability > Collectors*, click *+Data Collector*. Choose Redis.
+
Select the Operating System or Platform on which the Telegraf agent is installed. 

. If you haven't already installed an Agent for collection, or you wish to install an Agent for a different Operating System or Platform, click _Show Instructions_ to expand the link:task_config_telegraf_agent.html[Agent installation] instructions.

. Select the Agent Access Key for use with this data collector. You can add a new Agent Access Key by clicking the *+ Agent Access Key* button. Best practice: Use a different Agent Access Key only when you want to group data collectors, for example, by OS/Platform.

. Follow the configuration steps to configure the data collector. The instructions vary depending on the type of Operating System or Platform you are using to collect data.
