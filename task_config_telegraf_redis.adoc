Cloud Insights uses this data collector to gather metrics from Redis. Redis is an open source, in-memory data structure store used as a database, cache, and message broker, supporting the following data structures: strings, hashes, lists, sets, and more. 

== Installation 

. From *Admin > Data Collectors*, click *+Data Collector*. Under *Services*, choose Redis.
+
If you haven't configured an Agent for collection, you are prompted to link:task_config_telegraf_agent.html[install an agent] in your environment.
+
If you have an agent already configured, select the appropriate Operating System or Platform and click *Continue*.

. Follow the instructions in the Redis Configuration screen to configure the data collector. The instructions vary depending on the type of Operating System or Platform you are using to collect data. The example below shows the instructions for Windows:
