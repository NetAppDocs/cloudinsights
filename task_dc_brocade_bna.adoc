Data Infrastructure Insights uses the Brocade Network Advisor data collector to acquire inventory and performance data from Brocade switches. 

== Terminology 

Data Infrastructure Insights acquires the following inventory information from the Brocade Network Advisor data collector. For each asset type acquired by Data Infrastructure Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collector.

== Requirements 

The following are required to configure this data collector: 

* The Data Infrastructure Insights Acquisition Unit will initate connections to TCP port 443 on the BNA server. BNA server must be running version 14.2.1 or higher.
* Brocade Network Advisor Server IP address
* User name and password to an administrator account
* Port requirement: HTTP/HTTPS 443

== Troubleshooting
Some things to try if you encounter problems with this data collector:

=== Inventory

|Problem:|Try this:
|Receive a message that more than 1 node is logged into the Access Gateway port, or data collector fails to discover Access Gateway device.| Check that the NPV device is operating correctly and that all connected WWNs are expected. Do not directly acquire the NPV device. Instead, acquisition of the core fabric switch will collect the NPV device data.
