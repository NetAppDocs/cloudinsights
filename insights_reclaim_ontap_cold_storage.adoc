The _Reclaim ONTAP Cold Storage_ Insight provides data about cold capacity, potential cost/power savings and recommended action items for volumes on ONTAP systems.

NOTE: The _Reclaim ONTAP Cold Storage_ Insight is considered a link:concept_preview_features.html[_Preview_] feature and is therefore subject to change.

The Insight name gives a summary of the amount of data detected as "cold" and which storage that data resides on. The table also provides a count of workloads with cold data.
Selecting an Insight from the list opens a page showing more details, including recommendations to move data to the Cloud or cycle down unised disks, as well as estimated cost and power savings you could potentially realize from implementing those recommendations. The page even provides a handy link to link:https://bluexp.netapp.com/cloud-tiering-service-tco[NetApp's TCO Calculator] so you can experiment with the numbers.

On the Insight page, expand the *Recommendations* to explore the following options:

*Move unused workloads (zombies) to a lower cost storage tier (HDD) 
+
Utilizing the zombie flag, cold storage and number of days, find the coldest and largest amount of data and move the workload to a lower cost storage tier (such as a storage pool using hard disk storage)

* Delete unused workloads
+
Verify which workloads are not in use and consider archiving them or remove them from the storage system. The zombie flag indicates no relevant IO activity has been seen on a particular workload for the specified number of days cold. 

* Consider NetApp's Fabric Pool Solution
+
NetApp's Fabric Pool Solution automatically tiers cold data to low cost cloud storage, thus increasing the effiecency of your performance tier as well as providing remote data protection.
