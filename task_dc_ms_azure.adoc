Cloud Insights uses the Azure compute data collector to acquire inventory and performance data from Azure compute instances. 

== Requirements

You need the following information to configure this data collector.

* Port requirement: 443 HTTPS
* Azure Management Rest IP (management.azure.com) 
* Azure service principal client ID (user account)
* Azure service principal authentication key (user password)
* You need to set up an Azure account for Cloud Insights discovery.

Once the account is properly configured and you register the application in Azure, you will have the credentials required to discover the Azure instance with Cloud Insights. The following link describes how to set up the account for discovery:
