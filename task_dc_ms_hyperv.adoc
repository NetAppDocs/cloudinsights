The Microsoft Hyper-V data collector acquires inventory and performance data from the virtualized server computing environment. This data collector can discover a standalone Hyper-V host, or an entire cluster - create one collector per standalone host or cluster.

== Terminology

Data Infrastructure Insights acquires the following inventory information from the Microsoft Hyper-V (WMI). For each asset type acquired by Data Infrastructure Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Vendor/Model Term|Data Infrastructure Insights Term 
|Virtual Hard Disk|Virtual Disk
|Host|Host
|Virtual Machine|Virtual Machine
|Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV), Partition Volume|Data Store
|Internet SCSI Device, Multi Path SCSI LUN|LUN
|Fiber Channel Port|Port
|===

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collector. 

== Requirements

The following are required to configure this data collector:

* The Hyper-V requires port 5985 opened for data collection and remote access/management.
* IP address or FQDN of cluster or standalone hypervisor. Using the floating cluster hostname or IP is likely the most reliable approach versus pointing the collector at just one specific node in a cluster.
* Administrative-level user account that works on all the hypervisors in the cluster.
* WinRM needs to be enabled and listening on all hypervisors
* Port requirements: Port 135 via WMI & Dynamic TCP ports assigned 1024-65535 for Windows 2003 and older and 49152-65535 for Windows 2008. 
* DNS resolution must succeed, even if the data collector is pointed at only an IP address
* Each Hyper-V hypervisor must have “Resource Metering” turned on for every VM, on every host. This allows each hypervisor to have more data available for Data Infrastructure Insights on each guest. If this is not set, fewer performance metrics are acquired for each guest. More information on Resource metering can be found in the Microsoft documentation:

NOTE: The Hyper-V data collector requires a Windows Acquisition Unit. 

////
Best Practice: It is highly recommended for each Hyper-V hypervisor to have “Resource Metering” turned on for every VM, on every host. This allows each hypervisor to have more data available for Data Infrastructure Insights on each guest. If this is not set, fewer performance metrics are acquired for each guest. More information on Resource metering can be found in the link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-R2-and-2012/hh831661(v=ws.11)[Microsoft documentation].
