There are many challenges facing IT operations today. Administrators are being asked to do more with less, and having full visibility into your dynamic data centers is a must. In this example, we will show you how to create a dashboard with widgets that give you operational insights into the virtual machine (VM) performance in your environment. By following this example, and creating widgets to target your own specific needs, you can do things like visualizing backend storage performance compared to frontend virtual machine performance, or viewing VM latency versus I/O demand.

//Custom dashboards allow to you to prioritize efforts and identify resource availability. You can respond to the ebb and flow of workloads and minimize the time to detect and remediate emerging issues. Custom dashboards allow you the flexibility to create prioritized views into business-critical infrastructure, and are useful for identifying performance availability across multi-vendor technologies.

.About this task

Here we will create a Virtual Machine Performance dashboard containing the following:

* a table listing VM names and performance data
* a chart comparing VM Latency to Storage Latency
* a chart showing Read, Write and Total IOPS for VMs
* a chart showing Max Throughput for your VMs

This is just a basic example. You can customize your dashboard to highlight and compare any performance data you choose, in order to target for your own operational best practices.

.Steps

. Log in to Insight as a user with administrative permissions.

. From the *Dashboards* menu, select *[+New dashboard]*.
+
The *New dashboard* page opens.

. At the top of the page, enter a unique name for the dashboard, for example "VM Performance by Application".

. Click *Save* to save the dashboard with the new name.

. Let's start adding our widgets. If necessary, click the *Edit* icon to enable Edit mode.

. Click the *Add Widget* icon and select *Table* to add a new table widget to the dashboard.
+
The Edit Widget dialog opens. The default data displayed is for all storages in your environment.

. We can customize this widget. In the Name field at the top, delete "Widget 1" and enter "Virtual Machine Performance table".

. Click the asset type drop-down and change _Storage_ to _Virtual Machine_.
+
The table data changes to show all virtual machines in your environment. 

. Let's add a few columns to the table. Click the Gear icon on the right and select _Hypervisor name_, _IOPS - Total_, and _Latency - Total_. You can also try typing the name into the search to quickly display the desired field.
+
These columns are now displayed in the table. You can sort the table by any of these columns. Note that the columns are displayed in the order in which they were added to the widget.

. For this exercise we will exclude VMs that are not actively in use, so let's filter out anything with less than 10 total IOPS. Click the *[+]* button next to *Filter by* and select _IOPS - Total_. Click on *Any* and enter "10" in the *from* field. Leave the *to* field empty. Click outsude the filter field or press Enter to set the filter.
+
The table now shows only VMs with 10 or more total IOPS.

. We can further collapse the table by grouping results. Click the *[+]* button next to *Group by* and select a field to group by, such as _Application_ or _Hypervisor name_. Grouping is automatically applied.
+
The table rows are now grouped according to your setting. You can expand and collapse the groups as needed. Grouped rows show rolled up data for each of the columns. Some columns allow you to choose the roll up method for that column.

. When you have customized the table widget to your satisfaction, click the *[Save]* button.
+
The table widget is saved to the dashboard.

You can resize the widget on the dashboard by dragging the lower-right corner. Make the widget wider to show all the columns clearly. Click *Save* to save the current dashboard.

Next we will add some charts to show our VM Performance. Let's create a line chart comparing VM latency with VMDK latency.

. If necessary, click the *Edit* icon on the dashboard to enable Edit mode.

. Click the *[Add widget]* icon and select _Line Chart_ to add a new line chart widget to the dashboard.

. The *Edit Widget* dialog opens. Name this widget "VM / VMDK Max Latency"

. Select *Virtual Machine* and choose _Latency - Max_. Set any filters you wish, or leave *Filter by* empty. For *Roll up*, choose _Sum_ by _All_. Display this data as a _Line Chart_, and leave _Y-Axis_ as _Primary_.

. Click the *[+Query]* button to add a second data line. For this line, select _VMDK_ and _Latency - Max_. Set any filters you wish, or leave *Filter by* empty. For *Roll up*, choose _Sum_ by _All_. Display this data as a _Line Chart_, and leave _Y-Axis_ as _Primary_.

. Click *[Save]* to add this widget to the dashboard.

Next we will add a chart showing VM Read, Write and Total IOPS in a single chart.

. Click the *[Add widget]* icon and select _Area Chart_ to add a new area chart widget to the dashboard.

. The Edit Widget dialog opens. Name this widget "VM IOPS"

. Select *Virtual Machine* and choose _IOPS - Total_. Set any filters you wish, or leave *Filter by* empty. for *Roll up*, choose _Sum_ by _All_. Display this data as an _Area Chart_, and leave _Y-Axis_ as _Primary_.

. Click the *[+Query]* button to add a second data line. For this line, select *Virtual Machine* and choose _IOPS - Read_.

. Click the *[+Query]* button to add a third data line. For this line, select *Virtual Machine* and choose _IOPS - Write_.

. Click *Show legend* to display a legend for this widget on the dashboard.

. Click *[Save]* to add this widget to the dashboard.

Next we will add a chart showing VM Throughput for each Application associated with the VM. We will use the Roll Up feature for this.

. Click the *[Add widget]* icon and select _Line Chart_ to add a new line chart widget to the dashboard.

. The Edit Widget dialog opens. Name this widget "VM Throughput by Application"

. Select Virtual Machine and choose Throughput - Total. Set any filters you wish, or leave Filter by empty. For Roll up, choose "Max" and select by "Application" or "Name". Show the Top 10 applications. Display this data as a Line Chart, and leave Y-Axis as Primary.

. Click *[Save]* to add this widget to the dashboard.

You can move widgets on the dashboard by holding down the mouse button anywhere in the top of the widget and dragging it to a new location. 

You can resize widgets by dragging the lower-right corner. 

Be sure to *[Save]* the dashboard after you make your changes.

Your final VM Performance Dashboard will look something like this:
