The HP Enterprise Alletra 6000 (previously Nimble) data collector supports inventory and performance data for Alletra 6000 storage arrays. 

== Terminology 

Data Infrastructure Insights acquires the following inventory information from this collector. For each asset type acquired by Data Infrastructure Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Vendor/Model Term|Data Infrastructure Insights Term 
|Array|Storage
|Disk|Disk
|Volume|Volume
|Pool|Storage Pool
|Initiator|Storage Host Alias
|Controller|Storage Node
|Fibre Channel Interface|Controller
|===

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collector. 

== Requirements

You must have the following in order to collect inventory and configuration data from the storage array:

* The array must be installed and configured, and reachable from the client through its fully qualified domain name (FQDN) or array management IP address.
* The array must be running NimbleOS 2.3.x or later.
* You must have a valid user name and password to the array with at least "Operator" level role. The "Guest" role does not have sufficient access to understand initiator configurations.
* Port 5392 must be open on the array.

You must have the following in order to collect performance data from the storage array:

* The array must be running NimbleOS 4.0.0 or later
* The array must have volumes configured. The only performance API NimbleOS has is for volumes, and any statistics Data Infrastructure Insights reports are derived from the statistics on volumes
