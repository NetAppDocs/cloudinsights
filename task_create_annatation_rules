= Creating annotation rules
[.lead]
You can use annotation rules to automatically apply annotations to multiple assets based on criteria that you define. Cloud Insights assigns the annotations to assets based on these rules. Annotations set manually on an individual asset pages take precedence over rule-based annotations when Cloud Insight evaluates the annotation rules.

.Before you begin
You must have created a query for the annotation rule.

.Steps

. In the Cloud Insights menu click *Manage > Annotation rules*.
+
The Add Rule dialog is displayed.
. Do the following:
.. In the *Name* box, enter a unique name that describes the rule.
+
The name appears in the Annotation Rules page.
.. Click *Query* and select the query that Cloud Insights uses to identify the assets the annotation applies to.
.. Click *Annotation* and select the annotation you want to apply.
.. Click *Value* and select a value for the annotation.
+
For example, if you choose Birthday as the annotation, you specify a date for the value.
.. Click *Save*
.. Click *Run all rules* if you want to run all the rules immediately; otherwise, the rules are run at a regularly scheduled interval.
