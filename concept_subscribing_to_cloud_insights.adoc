While using Cloud Insights, if you see a padlock icon image:padlock.png[Padlock], it means the feature is not available in your current Edition, or is available in a limited form. Upgrade for full access to the feature.

== Trial Version
When you sign up for Cloud Insights and your environment is active, you enter into a free, 30-day trial of Cloud Insights. During this trial you can explore the features that Cloud Insights has to offer, in your own environment.   

At any time during your trial period, you can subscribe to Cloud Insights. Subscribing to Cloud Insights ensures uninterrupted access to your data as well as extended link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/concept_requesting_support.html[*product support*] options. 

Cloud Insights displays a banner when your free trial is nearing its end. Within that banner is a _View Subscription_ link, which opens the *Admin > Subscription* page. Non-Admin users will see the banner but will not be able to go to the Subscription page.

NOTE: If you need additional time to evaluate Cloud Insights and your trial is set to expire in 4 days or less, you can extend your trial for an additional 30 days. You can extend the trial only once. You cannot extend if your trial has expired.

=== What if My Trial has Expired?

If your free trial has expired and you have not yet subscribed to Cloud Insights, you will have limited functionality until you subscribe.  

== Subscription Options

To subscribe, go to *Admin > Subscription*. In addition to the *Subscribe* buttons, you will be able to see your installed data collectors and calculate your estimated pricing. For a typical environment, you can click the self-serve AWS Marketplace *Subscribe Now* button. If your environment includes or is expected to include 1,000 or more Managed Units, you are eligible for Volume Pricing. 

image:SubscriptionCompareTable-2.png[Subscription Options]

=== Pricing
Cloud Insights is priced per *Managed Unit*. Usage of your Managed Units is calculated based on the number of *hosts or virtual machines* and amount of *unformatted capacity* being managed in your infrastructure environment.

* 1 Managed Unit = 2 hosts (any virtual or physical machine)
* 1 Managed Unit = 4 TiB of unformatted capacity of physical or virtual disks

Note that the following data collectors are metered at a different Raw TiB to Managed Unit rate. Every 40TiB of unformatted capacity on these data collectors is charged as 1 Managed Unit (MU): 

* Dell EMC ECS
* Hitachi Content Platform
* IBM Cleversafe
* NetApp StorageGrid

If your environment includes or is expected to include 1,000 or more Managed Units, you are eligible for *Volume Pricing* and will be prompted to Contact NetApp Sales to subscribe. See <<how-do-i-subscribe,below>> for more details.

=== Estimate Your Subscription Cost
The Subscription Calculator gives you an estimated list-price monthly Cloud Insights cost based on the number of hosts and amount of unformatted capacity being reported by your data collectors. The current values are pre-populated in the _Hosts_ and _Unformatted Capacity_ fields. You can enter different values to assist you with planning for estimated future growth.

Your estimated list price cost will change based on your subscription term.

NOTE: The calculator is for estimation only. Your exact pricing will be set when you subscribe.

== How Do I Subscribe?

If your Managed Unit count is less than 1,000, you can subscribe via NetApp Sales, or <<self-subscribe-via-aws-marketplace,self-subscribe>> via AWS Marketplace.

=== Subscribe through NetApp Sales direct

If your expected Managed Unit count is 1,000 or greater, click on the link:https://www.netapp.com/us/forms/sales-inquiry/cloud-insights-sales-inquiries.aspx[*Contact Sales*] button to subscribe though the NetApp Sales Team. 

You must provide your Cloud Insights *Serial Number* to your NetApp sales representative so that your paid subscription can be applied to your Cloud Insights environment. The Serial Number uniquely identifies your Cloud Insights trial environment and can be found on the *Admin > Subscription* page.

=== Self-Subscribe through AWS Marketplace

NOTE: You must be an Account Owner or Administrator in order to apply an AWS Marketplace subscription to your existing Cloud Insights trial account. Additionally, you must have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.  

Clicking on the *Subscribe Now* button opens the AWS link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07HM8QQGY[Cloud Insights] subscription page, where you can complete your subscription. Note that values you entered in the calculator are not populated in the AWS subscription page; you will need to enter the total Managed Units count on this page.

After you have entered the total Managed Units count and chosen either 12-month or 36-month subscription term, click on *Set Up Your Account* to finish the subscription process.

Once the AWS subscription process is complete, you will be taken back to your Cloud Insights environment. Or, if the environment is no longer active (for example, you have logged out), you will be taken to the Cloud Central sign-in page. When you sign in to Cloud Insights again, your subscription will be active. 

NOTE: After clicking on *Set Up Your account* on the AWS Marketplace page, you must complete the AWS subscription process within one hour. If you do not complete it within one hour, you will need to click on *Set Up Your Account* again to complete the process.

If there is a problem and the subscription process fails to complete correctly, you will still see the "Trial Version" banner when you log into your environment. In this event, you can go to *Admin > Subscription* and repeat the subscription process.



== View Your Subscription Status

Once your subscription is active, you can view your subscription status and Managed Unit usage from the *Admin > Subscription* page.

//image:Subscription_Summary.png[Subscription Status ] 
image:Subscription_Status_Usage.png[Viewing your subscription ststus]

The Subscription Details tab displays the following:

* Current subscription or active Edition 
* Details about your subscription
* Links to modify your subscription or estimate cost changes
//* Contract term and expiration date
//* Current Managed Unit usage, including breakdown counts for hosts and capacity
//* Link to modify your subscription 


== View your Usage Management

The Usage Management tab shows an overview of Managed Unit usage, as well as a list of the Data Collectors installed in your environment and the breakdown of Managed Units for each.

NOTE: The Unformatted Capacity Managed Unit count reflects a sum of the total raw capacity in the environment and is rounded up to the nearest Managed Unit. 

//=== Installed Data Collectors

//Click on the *View Data Collectors* button to expand the list of installed Data Collectors. 

//image:Subscription_Installed_Data_Collectors.png[Data Collectors]

//The Data Collectors section shows the Data Collectors installed in your environment and the breakdown of Managed Units for each. 

NOTE: The sum of Managed Units may differ slightly from the Data Collectors count in the summary section. This is because Managed Unit counts are rounded up to the nearest Managed Unit. The sum of these numbers in the Data Collectors list may be slightly higher than the total Managed Units in the status section. The summary section reflects your actual Managed Unit count for your subscription.

In the event that your usage is nearing or exceeding your subscribed amount, you can delete data collectors in this list by clicking on the "three dots" menu and selecting _Delete_.



=== What Happens if I Exceed My Subscribed Usage?

Warnings are displayed when your Managed Unit usage exceeds 80%, 90%, and 100% of your total subscribed amount:

|===
*When usage exceeds:* | *This happens / Recommended action:*
|*80%* | An informational banner is displayed. No action is necessary.
| *90%* | A warning banner is displayed. You may want to increase your subscribed Managed Unit count.
| *100%*| An error banner is displayed and you will have limited functionality until you do one of the following:
* Modify your subscription to increase the subscribed Managed Unit count
* Remove Data Collectors so that your Managed Unit usage is at or below your subscribed amount
|===

== Subscribe Directly and Skip the Trial

You can also subscribe to Cloud Insights directly from the link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07HM8QQGY[AWS Marketplace], without first creating a trial environment. Once your subscription is complete and your environment is set up, you will immediately be subscribed.

== Adding an Entitlement ID

If you own a valid NetApp product that is bundled with Cloud Insights, you can add that product serial number to your existing Cloud Insights subscription. For example, if you have purchased NetApp Astra Control Center, the Astra Control Center license serial number can be used to identify the subscription in Cloud Insights. Cloud Insights refers to this an _Entitlement ID_.

To add an entitlement ID to your Cloud Insights subscription, on the *Admin > Subscription* page, click _+Entitlement ID_.
