Cloud Insights gives you a free 14-day trial so you can explore the features with your own data before subscribing.

Flow:
* Sign Up for Cloud Insights
* Start free trial & explore Cloud Insights
* Subscribe to Cloud Insights

Subscribing to Cloud Insights ensures uninterrupted access to your data as well as extended product link:https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/concept_requesting_support.html[support] options. You can subscribe to Cloud Insights at any point during your free trial.

Cloud Insights is priced by *Managed Unit*. Managed Unit use is calculated based on the number of *hosts* and amount of *raw storage capacity* being managed in your infrastructure environment.

* 1 Managed Unit = 1 host (any virtual or physical machine)
* 1 Managed Unit = 2 TB of raw storage capacity

== Trial Mode
When you sign up for Cloud Insights and your site (also known as _instance_ or _tenant_) is active, you enter into a free, 14-day Trial of Cloud Insights. During this trial you can explore all the features that Cloud Insights has to offer. 

At any time during your trial period, you can subscribe to Cloud Insights. When you subscribe, you will be taken to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud Insights subscription page.

NOTE: You must be an Account Owner or Administrator in order to subscribe to Cloud Insights. Additionally, you must have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) account with the same email address as your Cloud Insights Account Owner or Administrator login.

Cloud Insights will display a banner when your free trial is nearing its end. Within that banner is a link to the Subscription page. Non-Admin users will see the banner but will not be able to go to the Subscription page.

If your free trial has expired and you have not yet subscribed to Cloud Insights, you will have limited functionality until you subscribe. Your data will still be collected for 14 days after the end of your trial, in order to ensure non-interrupted flow until your subscription is active. After 14 days, if you have not subscribed, Cloud Insights will stop collecting data.

To subscribe, go to *Admin > Subscribe*. In addition to the *Subscribe Now* button, you will be able to see your installed data collectors and calculate your estimated pricing.

=== Estimate Your Subscription Cost

The Subscription Calculator gives you an estimated monthly Cloud Insights cost based on the number of hosts and amount of raw storage capacity being reported by your data collectors. The current values are pre-populated in the _Hosts_ and _Raw Capacity_ fields. You can enter different values to assist you with planning for estimated future growth.

Your estimated cost will change based on whether you select a subscription term of 12 months or 36 months. The 36-month term includes a discounted cost per Managed Unit.

NOTE: The calculator is for estimation only. Your final pricing will be set when you subscribe. 

// Can extend only once.

Clicking on the *Subscribe Now* button opens the AWS Cloud Insights subscription page, where you can complete your subscription. Note that values you entered in the calculator are not populated in the AWS subscription page; you will need to re-enter your values on this page.

After you complete the AWS subscription process, you will be taken back to the Cloud Central login screen. When you log in to Cloud Insights again, your subscription will be active.  

NOTE: You must complete the AWS subscription process within one hour of starting it. If you do not complete it within on hour, you will need to re-start the AWS subscription.

NOTE: If you choose to cancel your Cloud Insights subscription, you must do so within 48 hours of subscribing. You can cancel your subscription from the AWS Support page. 

== Subscription Mode

Once your subscription is active, you can view your subscription status and Managed Unit usage on the *Admin > Subscription* page.
