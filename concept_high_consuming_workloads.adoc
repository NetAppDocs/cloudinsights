High-impact workloads can reduce the performance of other workloads in a shared resource. Cloud Insights provides tools to help you investigate resource saturation and impact in your environment.


=== Terminology

When talking about workload or resource impact, the following definitions are useful.

An *Impactful* or _Greedy_ resource is one that causes a negative impact on another resource. For example, a volume experiencing very high IOPS may cause increased latency in other volumes (i.e. _Impacted_ or _Degraded_ resources). Impactful and Impacted resources are “peers” that utilize the same shared resource, for example, a storage pool or Volume.

A *High-Consuming Workload* is a workload that is currently identified as impacting other resources in the shared storage pool. These workloads drive higher IOPS, reducing IOPS in the Impacted Workloads. In Cloud Insights these are identified as *Demanding Workloads*.

An *Impacted Workload* is a workload affected by a high-consuming workload in the shared Storage Pool. These workloads are experiencing reduced IOPS and/or higher latency, caused by the Demanding Workloads.

*Shared Resource Saturation* is the ratio of impacting IOPS to _baseline_.

*Baseline* is defined as the maximum reported data point for each workload in the hour immediately preceding the detected saturation.

A *Contention* occurs when IOPS are determined to be affecting other resources or workloads in the shared storage pool. 


=== High-Consuming Workloads

To start looking into Impactful and impacted workloads in your shared resources, click on *Dashboards > High Consuming Workloads* in the Cloud Insights menu.

Cloud Insights displays a list of any workloads where a saturation has been detected. Click on a workload to open the workload dashboard.

=== What do I do to resolve saturation?

There are a number of steps you can take to reduce or eliminate the chance of saturation in your environment. Here are a few things you can try.

* Move high-IOPS consumers
+
Move the "greedy" workloads to less-saturated Storage Pools. It is recommended to assess the tier and capacity of these pools before moving the workloads, to avoid unnecessary costs or additional contentions.

* Implement a quality of service (QoS) policy
+
Implementing a QoS policy per workload to ensure enough free resources available will alleviate saturation on the Storage Pool. This is a long-term solution.

* Add additional resources
+
If the shared resource (for example, Storage Pool) has reached the IOPS saturation point, adding more or faster disks to the pool will ensure enough free resources available to alleviate saturation.
