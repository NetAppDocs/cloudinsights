*Admin > Data Collectors > User Directory Collectors > + User Directory Collector*
+
The system displays the Add User Directory screen.

== Testing Your User Directory Collector Configuration 

You can validate LDAP User Permissions and Attribute Definitions using the following procedures:

* Use the following command to validate Cloud Secure LDAP user permission:
+
`ldapsearch -o ldif-wrap=no -LLL -x -b "dc=netapp,dc=com" -h 10.235.40.29 -p 389 -D Administrator@netapp.com -W`

* Use AD Explorer to navigate an AD database, view object properties and attributes, view permissions, view an object's schema, execute sophisticated searches that you can save and re-execute. 

** Install AD explorer https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/adexplorer
** Connect to the AD server using the username/password of the AD directory server.



== Troubleshooting User Directory Collector Configuration Errors

The following table describes known problems and resolutions that can occur during collector configuration:

[cols=2*,  cols"50,50"]
[options="header"]
|===
|Problem: | Resolution:
|Adding a User Directory connector results in the ‘Error’ state.|Ensure you have provided valid values for the required fields (Server, forest-name, bind-DN, bind-Password).
Ensure bind-DN input is always provided as ‘Administrator@<domain_forest_name>’ or as a user account with domain admin privileges.
|The optional attributes of domain user are not appearing in the Cloud Secure User Profile page.|Ensure you  have used the AD domain user ‘Attribute Editor’ to enter the optional attributes.
