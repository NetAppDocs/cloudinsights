To identify unexpected changes, you can view an audit trail of the Cloud Insights system and its user activities.

Cloud Insights generates audit entries for changes that impact the system or users. These changes include:

    * Logging in
    * Authorizing or unauthorizing a path
    * Updating an authorized path
    * Setting global policies or thresholds
    * Adding or removing a data collector
    * Starting or stopping a data collector
    * Updating data collector properties
    * Adding, editing, or deleting a task
    * Removing an application group
    * Identifying or changing the identification for a device

Use the following steps to access the Audit system:

.Steps

. In the Cloud Insights menu, click *Admin > Audit*
+
The Audit page is displayed, providing the following details for each audit entry:

* *Time* - Date and time that the changes were made
* *User* - User account's role, (guest, user, or administrator)
* *Role* - The user's role in Cloud Insights
* *IP* - IP address associated with the audit entry
* *Action* - Type of activity in the audit entry
* *Details* - Details of the audit entry

When there is a user activity that affects a resource, such as a data collector or an application, the details include a link to the resource's landing page.

*Note* When a data collector is deleted, the user activity details related to the data collector no longer contain a link to the data collector's landing page.

== Displaying audit entries

There are a number of different ways to view audit entries:

* You can display audit entries by choosing a particular time period (1 hour, 3 hours, 24 hours, 3 days, and 7 days), with Cloud Insights showing a maximum number of 1000 violations for the selected time period.

* You change the sort order of the columns in a table to either ascending (up arrow) or descending (down arrow) by clicking the arrow in the column header.
+
By default, the table displays the entries in descending time order.

* You can use the filter box to show only the entries you want in the table.
