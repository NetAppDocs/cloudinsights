[.lead]
Response Policies trigger actions such as taking a snapshot or restricting user access in the event of an attack or abnormal user behavior. 


You can set policies on specific devices or all devices. To set a response policy, select *Admin > Automated Response Policies* and click the appropriate *+Policy* button. You can create policies for Attacks or for Warnings.

You must save the policy with a unique name. 

To disable an automated response action (for example, Take Snapshot), simply un-check the action and save the policy.

When an alert is triggered against the specified devices (or all devices, if selected), the automated response policy takes a snapshot of your data. You can see snapshot status on the link:cs_alert_data.html#the-alert-details-page[Alert detail page].

See the link:cs_restrict_user_access.html[Restrict User Access] page for more details on restricting user access by IP.

You can modify or pause an Automated Response Policy by choosing the option in the policy's drop-down menu.

Workload Security will automatically delete snapshots once per day based on the Snapshot Purge settings.
