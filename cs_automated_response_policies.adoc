Response Policies trigger actions such as taking a snapshot in the event of an attack or abnormal user behavior. 

You can set policies on specific devices or all devices. To set a response policy, select *Admin > Automated Response Policies* and click the appropriate *+Policy+ button. You can create policies for Attacks or for Warnings.

You must save the policy with a unique name.

When an alert is triggered against the specified devices (or all devices, if selected), the automated response policy takes a snapshot of your data. You can see snapshot status on the link:cs_alert_data.html#the-alert-details-page[Alert detail page].

You can modify or pause an Automated Response Policy by choosing the option in the policy's drop-down menu.
