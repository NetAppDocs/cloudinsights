Anomaly Detection provides insight into variations to the "usual" patterns of data in your environment. An anomaly is a variation in a metric value for an object or group of objects, compared to historical information week over week. For example, if a pod's CPU utilization was at ~50% on Tuesday at 12:05 PM in previous weeks, but is at 100% this Tuesday at 12:05 PM, that would be considered an anomaly.
