The IBM PowerVM (SSH) data collector is used to collect information about virtual partitions running on IBM POWER hardware instances managed by a hardware management console (HMC).

== Terminology

Cloud Insights acquires inventory information from the virtual partitions running on IBM POWER hardware instances. For each asset type acquired, the most common terminology used for the asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Vendor/Model Term | Cloud Insights Term
|hdisk |Virtual Disk
|Managed System|Host
|LPAR, VIO Server|Virtual Machine
|Volume Group|Data Store
|Physical Volume|LUN
|===

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collector. 

== Requirements 

The following requirements must be met to configure and use this data collector:

* IP address of the Hardware Management Console (HMC)
* User name and password that provide access to Hardware Management Console (HMC) through SSH
* Port requirement SSH-22
* View permission on all management systems and logical partition security domains
+
The user must also have View permission on HMC configurations and the ability to collect VPD information for the HMC console security grouping. The user must also be allowed Virtual IO Server Command access under the Logical Partition security grouping. It is a best practice to start from a role of an operator and then remove all roles. Read-only users on the HMC do not have privileges to run proxied commands on AIX hosts.

* IBM best practice is to have the devices monitored by two or more HMCs. Be aware that this may cause OnCommand Insight to report duplicated devices, therefore it is highly recommended to add redundant devices to the "Exclude Devices" list in the Advanced Configuration for this data collector.
