Cloud Insights uses this data collector to gather metrics from HAProxy.

NOTE: This topic is considered Preview documentation and is subject to change.

== Installation

. From *Admin > Data Collectors*, click *+Data Collector*. Under *Services*, choose HAProxy.
+
If you haven't configured an Agent for collection, you are prompted to link:task_config_telegraf_agent.html[install an agent] in your environment.
+
If you have an agent already configured, select the appropriate Operating System or Platform and click *Continue*.

. Follow the instructions in the HAProxy Configuration screen to configure the data collector. The instructions vary depending on the type of Operating System or Platform you are using to collect data. The example below shows the instructions for Linux:

== Setup

Telegraf's plugin for HAProxy relies on HAProxy Stats enablement. This is a configuration built into HAProxy but it is not enabled out of the box. When enabled, HAProxy will expose an HTML endpoint that can be viewed on your browser or scraped for extraction of status of all HAProxy configurations.

==== Compatibility:
Configuration was developed against HAProxy version 1.9.4.

==== Setting Up:

To enable stats, edit your haproxy configuration file and add the the following lines after the 'defaults' section, using your own user/password and/or haproxy URL:

----
stats enable
stats auth myuser:mypassword
stats uri  /haproxy?stats
----

The following is a simplified example configuration file with stats enabled:

----
global
  daemon
  maxconn 256
 
defaults
  mode http
  stats enable
  stats uri /haproxy?stats
  stats auth myuser:mypassword
  timeout connect 5000ms
  timeout client 50000ms
  timeout server 50000ms
 
frontend http-in
  bind *:80
  default_backend servers
 
frontend http-in9080
  bind *:9080
  default_backend servers_2
 
backend servers
  server server1 10.128.0.55:8080 check ssl verify none
  server server2 10.128.0.56:8080 check ssl verify none
 
backend servers_2  
  server server3 10.128.0.57:8080 check ssl verify none
  server server4 10.128.0.58:8080 check ssl verify none
