Webhooks allow users to send alert notifications to various applications using a customized webhook channel. This page provides an example for setting up webhooks for Discord.

NOTE: This page refers to third-party instructions, which could be subject to change. Refer to the link:https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/228383668-Intro-to-Webhooks[Discord documentation] for the most up-to-date information. 

== Discord Setup:

* In Discord, select the Server, under Text Channels, select Edit Channel (gear icon)

* Select *Integrations > View Webhooks* and click *New Webhook*

* Copy the Webhook URL. You will need to paste this into the Cloud Insights webhook configuration.


== Create Cloud Insights Webhook:

. In Cloud Insights, navigate to *Admin > Notifications* and select the *Webhooks* tab. Click *+Webhook* to create a new webhook.

. Give the webhook a meaningful Name, such as "Discord".

NOTE: In order to test the webhook, temporarily replace the url value in the message body with any valid URL (such as _https://netapp.com_) then click the _Test Webhook_ button. Be sure to set the message body back once the test completes.

== Notifications via Webhook

To notify on events via webhook, in Cloud Insights navigate to *Alerts > Monitors* and click *+Monitor* to create a new link:task_create_monitor.html[monitor].

* Select a metric and define the monitor's conditions.

* Under _Set up team notification(s), choose the *Webhook* Delivery Method.

* Choose the "Discord" webhook for the desired events (Critical, Warning, Resolved)
