The NetApp SolidFire All-Flash Array data collector supports inventory and performance collection from both iSCSI and Fibre Channel SolidFire configurations. 

The SolidFire data collector utilizes the SolidFire REST API. The acquisition unit where the data collector resides needs to be able to initiate HTTPS connections to TCP port 443 on the SolidFire cluster management IP address. The data collector needs credentials capable of making REST API queries on the SolidFire cluster.

== Terminology 

Cloud Insights acquires the following inventory information from the NetApp SolidFire All-Flash Array data collector. For each asset type acquired by Cloud Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]

== Troubleshooting

When SolidFire reports an error it is displayed in Cloud Insights as follows:

 An error message was received from a SolidFire device while trying to retrieve data. 
 The call was <method> (<parameterString> ). The error message from the device was (check the device manual): <message>

Where:

•	The <method> is an HTTP method, such as GET or PUT.
•	The <parameterString> is a comma separated list of parameters that were included in the REST call.
•	The <message> is whatever the device returned as the error message.
