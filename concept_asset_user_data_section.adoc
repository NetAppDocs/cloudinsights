The User Data section of an asset page displays and enables you to change any user-defined data such as applications and annotations.

== Using the User Data section to assign or modify applications

You can assign applications running in your environment to certain assets (host, virtual machines, volumes, internal volumes, qtrees, and hypervisors). The User Data section enables you to change the application assigned to an asset or assign an application or additional applications to an asset.

.Steps
. Locate an asset page by doing either of the following:
.. Query for a list of assets and then select one from the list.
.. On a Dashboard, locate an asset name and click it.
.. Perform a search and choose an asset from the results.
+
The asset page displays. The User Data section of the page shows currently-assigned applications or annotations.

To change the application assigned, or to assign an application or additional applications, drop down the *Application* list and select the application(s) you want to assign to the asset. You can type to search for an application, or select one from the list.

// If you choose an application that is associated with a business entity, the business entity is automatically assigned to the asset. In this case, when you place your cursor over the business entity name, the word derived displays. If you want to maintain the entity for only the asset and not the associated application, you can manually override the assignment of the application.

To remove an application, drop down the application list and un-check the application.

== Using the User Data section to assign or modify annotations

When customizing Cloud Insights to track data for your corporate requirements, you can define specialized notes called annotations, and assign them to your assets. The User Data section of an asset page displays annotations assigned to an asset and also enables you to change the annotations assigned to that asset.

.Steps

. To add an annotation to the asset, in the User Data section of the asset page, click *+Annotation*.
. Select an annotation from the list.
. Click Value and do either of the following, depending on type of annotation you selected:
.. If the annotation type is list, date, or Boolean, select a value from the list.
.. If the annotation type is text, type a value.
. Click Save.

The annotation is assigned to the asset. You can later filter assets by annotation using a query. 

If you want to change the value of the annotation after you assign it, drop down the annotation list and enter a different value.

If the annotation is of list type for which the *Add values dynamically upon annotation assignment option* is selected, you can type to add a new value in addition to selecting an existing value.
