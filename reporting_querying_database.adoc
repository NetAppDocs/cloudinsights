[.lead]
Cloud Insights' powerful API allows users to query the Cloud Insights Reporting database directly, without going through the Cognos Reporting environment.

NOTE: This documentation refers to the Cloud Insights Reporting feature, which is available in the link:/concept_subscribing_to_cloud_insights.html#editions[Premium Edition].

== Odata

The Cloud Insights Reporting API follows the link:https://www.odata.org/[OData v4] (Open Data Protocol) standard for its querying of the Reporting database. 
For more information or to learn more, check out link:https://www.odata.org/getting-started/basic-tutorial/[this tutorial] on OData. 

All requests will start with the url _\https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata_

== Generating an APIKey

Read more about link:API_Overview.html[Cloud Insights APIs].

To generate an API key, do the following:

* Log into your Cloud Insights environment and select *Admin > API Access*.
* Click “+ API Access Token”.
* Enter a Name & Description.
* For type, choose _Data Warehouse_.
* Set Permissions as Read/Write.
* Set a desires Expiration date.
* Click “Save”, then *copy the key and save it* somewhere safe. You will not be able to access the full key later.

APIkeys are good for <<synchronous-or-asynchronous,_Sync_ or _Async_>>.

//<TBD More information>


== Direct query of tables

With the API Key in place, direct queries of the Reporting database are now possible. Long URLs may be simplified to \https://.../odata/ for display purposes rather than the full \https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/

Try simple queries like

* \https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_custom
* \https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_inventory
* \https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_inventory/storage
* \https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_inventory/disk
* \https://.../odata/dwh_custom/custom_queries


== REST API Examples

The URL for all calls is _\https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata_. 

* GET /{schema}/** - Retrieves data from the Reporting Database.

Format: _\https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/<schema_name>/<query>_

Example:

 https://<domain>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_inventory/fabric?$count=true&$orderby=name

Result:

 {
    "@odata.context": "$metadata#fabric",
    "@odata.count": 2,
    "value": [
        {
            "id": 851,
            "identifier": "10:00:50:EB:1A:40:3B:44",
            "wwn": "10:00:50:EB:1A:40:3B:44",
            "name": "10:00:50:EB:1A:40:3B:44",
            "vsanEnabled": "0",
            "vsanId": null,
            "zoningEnabled": "0",
            "url": "https://<domain>/web/#/assets/fabrics/941716"
        },
        {
            "id": 852,
            "identifier": "10:00:50:EB:1A:40:44:0C",
            "wwn": "10:00:50:EB:1A:40:44:0C",
            "name": "10:00:50:EB:1A:40:44:0C",
            "vsanEnabled": "0",
            "vsanId": null,
            "zoningEnabled": "0",
            "url": "https://<domain>/web/#/assets/fabrics/941836"
         }
     ]
 }

// Example: get all Storage Pools of storage with id 287 with expanded Internal Volume data: https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_inventory/storage(287)/storage_pool?$expand=internal_volume


////
 * POST /{schema}/** - Write data and create queries in dwh_custom schema of Data Warehouse database through ODATA protocol, requires ADMIN role

 Format: https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/<schema_name>/<table_name>. The body contains the record in JSON format

 Example: add a new record to the storage table: https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_custom/storage , Request body: {"storageId": 123, "storageName": "storage123"}

Creating queries: POST https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_custom/custom_queries -d '{"queryName": "<query_name>", "querySql": "<query_sql>"}'



 * PATCH /{schema}/** - Modify data and modify queries in dwh_custom schema of Data Warehouse database through ODATA protocol, requires ADMIN role

== Helpful Hints

Keep the following in mind when working with Reporting API queries.

* The query payload must be a valid JSON string
* The query payload must be contained in a single line
* Double quotes must be escaped, i.e. \"
* Tabs are supported as \t
* Avoid comments
* Lower-case table names are supported

Additionally:

* 2 Headers are required:
** Name “X-CloudInsights-ApiKey”
** Attribute Value “<apikey>”

Your API key will be specific to your Cloud Insights environment.



== Synchronous or Asynchronous?

By default, an API command will operate in _synchronous_ mode, meaning that you send the request and the response is returned immediately. However, at times a query may take a long time to execute, which could lead to the request timing out. To get around this, you can execute a request _asynchronously_. In asynchronous mode, the request will return a URL through which the execution can be monitored. The URL will return the result when it is ready.

To execute a query in async mode, add the header `*Prefer: respond-async*` to the request. Upon successful execution, the response will contain the following headers:

 Status Code: 202 (which means ACCEPTED)
 preference-applied: respond-async
 location: https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_custom/asyncStatus/<token>

Querying the location URL will return the same headers if the response is not ready yet, or will return with status 200 if the response is ready. The response content will be of type text and contains the http status of the original query and some metadata, followed by the results of the original query.

....
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
 OData-Version: 4.0
 Content-Type: application/json;odata.metadata=minimal
 oDataResponseSizeCounted: true

 { <JSON_RESPONSE> }
....

To see a list of all async queries and which of them are ready, use the following command:

 GET https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_custom/asyncList

The response has the following format:

 {
    "queries" : [
        {
            "Query": "https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_custom/heavy_left_join3?$count=true",
            "Location": "https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_custom/asyncStatus/<token>",
            "Finished": false
        }
    ]
 }
