[.lead]
Cloud Insights' powerful API allows users to query the Cloud Insights Reporting database directly, without going through the Cognos Reporting environment.

NOTE: This documentation refers to the Cloud Insights Reporting feature, which is available in the link:/concept_subscribing_to_cloud_insights.html#editions[Premium Edition].

== Odata

The Cloud Insights Reporting API follows the link:https://www.odata.org/[OData v4] (Open Data Protocol) standard for its querying of the Reporting database. 
For more information or to learn more, check out link:https://www.odata.org/getting-started/basic-tutorial/[this tutorial] on OData. 

== REST client setup for Synchronous Queries

Keep the following in mind when working with Reporting API queries.

* The query must be contained in a single line
* Double quotes must be escaped, i.e. \"
* Tabs are supported as \t
* Avoid comments
* Lower-case table names are supported
* Must be a valid JSON string

Additionally:

* 2 Headers are required:
** Name “X-CloudInsights-ApiKey”
** Attribute Value “<apikey>”

Your API key will be specific to your Cloud Insights environment.

////

* All requests will start with the url _\https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata_

== Generating an APIKey

Read more about link:API_Overview.html[Cloud Insights APIs].

To generate an API key, do the following:

* Log into your Cloud Insights environment and select *Admin > API Access*.
* Click “+ API Access Token”.
* Enter a Name & Description.
* For type, choose _Data Warehouse_.
* Set Permissions as Read/Write.
* Set a desires Expiration date.
* Click “Save”, then *copy the key and save it* somewhere safe. You will not be able to access the full key later.

APIkeys are good for _Sync_ or _Async_
<TBD More information>


== Direct query of tables

With the API Key in place, direct queries of the Reporting database are now possible. Long URLs may be simplified to \https://.../odata/ for display purposes rather than the full \https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/

Try simple queries like

* \https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_custom
* \https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_inventory
* \https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_inventory/storage
* \https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_inventory/disk
* \https://.../odata/dwh_custom/custom_queries


== REST API Examples

The URL for all calls is _\https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata_. 

 * GET /{schema}/** - Retrieves data from the Reporting Database, requires at least _Guest_ role.

 Format: \https://<Cloud Insights URL>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/<schema_name>/<query>
 
Example:

 \https://<domain>/rest/v1/dwh-management/odata/dwh_inventory/fabric?$count=true&$orderby=name

Result:

 {
    "@odata.context": "$metadata#fabric",
    "@odata.count": 2,
    "value": [
        {
            "id": 851,
            "identifier": "10:00:50:EB:1A:40:3B:44",
            "wwn": "10:00:50:EB:1A:40:3B:44",
            "name": "10:00:50:EB:1A:40:3B:44",
            "vsanEnabled": "0",
            "vsanId": null,
            "zoningEnabled": "0",
            "url": "https://<domain>/web/#/assets/fabrics/941716"
        },
        {
            "id": 852,
            "identifier": "10:00:50:EB:1A:40:44:0C",
            "wwn": "10:00:50:EB:1A:40:44:0C",
            "name": "10:00:50:EB:1A:40:44:0C",
            "vsanEnabled": "0",
            "vsanId": null,
            "zoningEnabled": "0",
            "url": "https://<domain>/web/#/assets/fabrics/941836"
         }
     ]
 }
