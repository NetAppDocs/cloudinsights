This data collector supports the Hitachi Content Platform (HCP) using the HCP Management API. 

NOTE: Hitachi Content Platform is metered at a different Raw TB to Managed Unit rate. Every 40 TB of unformatted HCP capacity is charged as 1 link:concept_subscribing_to_cloud_insights.html#pricing[Managed Unit (MU)].

== Terminology 

Data Infrastructure Insights acquires the following inventory information from the Hitachi HCP data collector. For each asset type acquired by Data Infrastructure Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Vendor/Model Term|Data Infrastructure Insights Term 
|HCP Cluster|Storage
|Tenant |Storage Pool|
|Namespace|Internal Volume
|Node|Node

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collector. 

== Inventory Requirements

You must have the following in order to collect inventory data:

* IP address of the HCP server
* Read-only user name and password for the HCP software and peer privileges

////
== Performance requirements 

The following requirements must be met in order to collect performance data:

* HDS USP, USP V, and VSP performance 
** Performance Monitor must be licensed.
** Monitoring switch must be enabled. 
** The Export Tool (Export.exe) must be copied to the Data Infrastructure Insights AU.
** The Export Tool version must match the microcode version of the target array.

* AMS performance:
** NetApp strongly recommends creating a dedicated service account on AMS arrays for Data Infrastructure Insights to use to retrieve performance data. Storage Navigator only allows a user account one concurrent login to the array. Having Data Infrastructure Insights use the same user account as management scripts or HiCommand may result in Data Infrastructure Insights, management scripts, or HiCommand being unable to communicate to the array due to the one concurrent user account login limit
** Performance Monitor must be licensed.
** The Storage Navigator Modular 2 (SNM2) CLI utility needs to be installed on the Data Infrastructure Insights AU.
