You can copy values in tables to the clipboard for use in search boxes or other applications.

.About this task
There are two methods you can use to copy values from tables or query results to the clipboard.

.Steps
. Method 1: Highlight the desired text with the mouse, copy it, and paste it into search fields or other applications.
. Method 2: For single-value fields, hover over the field and click the clipboard icon that appears. The value is copied to the clipboard for use in search fields or other applications.
+
Note that only values that are links to assets can be copied using this method. Only fields that include single values (i.e. non-lists) have the copy icon.
