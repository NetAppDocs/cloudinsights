This data collector acquires inventory and performance data from storage systems running ONTAP using read-only API calls from an administrator account.

== Terminology

Cloud Insights acquires inventory and performance data from the ONTAP data collector. For each asset type acquired, the most common terminology used for the asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

== Requirements

The following are requirements to configure and use this data collector:

* You must have access to an Administrator account used for read-only API calls.
* Username (with read-only role name to ontapi application to the default Vserver) and password to log into NetApp cluster)
* Port requirements: 80 or 443

== Troubleshooting
Some things to try if you encounter problems with this data collector:

==== Inventory

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:
|Receive 401 HTTP response or 13003 ZAPI error code and ZAPI returns “Insufficient privileges” or “not authorized for this command”| Check username and password, and user privileges/permissions.
|Cluster version is < 8.1| Cluster minimum supported version is 8.1. Upgrade to minimum supported version.
|ZAPI returns "cluster role is not cluster_mgmt LIF"|AU needs to talk to cluster management IP. Check the IP and change to a different IP if necessary
|Error: “7 Mode filers are not supported”| This can happen if you use this data collector to discover 7 mode filer. Change IP to point to cdot filer instead. 
|ZAPI command fails after retry| AU has communication problem with the cluster. Check network, port number, and IP address. User should also try to run a command from command line from the AU machine. 
|AU failed to connect to ZAPI via HTTP| Check whether ZAPI port accepts plaintext. If AU tries to send plaintext to an SSL socket, the communication fails.
|Communication fails with SSLException|AU is attempting to send SSL to a plaintext port on a filer. Check whether the ZAPI port accepts SSL, or use a different port.
|Additional Connection errors:

ZAPI response has error code 13001, “database  is not open”
  
ZAPI error code is 60 and response contains “API did not finish on time”
  
ZAPI response contains “initialize_session() returned NULL environment”
  
ZAPI error code is 14007 and response contains “Node is not healthy”

|Check network, port number, and IP address. User should also try to run a command from command line from the AU machine. 
|===

==== Performance
[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:
|“Failed to collect performance from ZAPI” error|This is usually due to perf stat not running. Try the following command on each node:

> _system node systemshell -node * -command “spmctl -h cmd –stop; spmctl -h cmd –exec”_
