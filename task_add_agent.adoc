Cloud Secure collects device data using one or more agents. Agents connect to devices in your environment and collect data that is sent to the Cloud Secure SaaS layer for analysis. 

.Before you begin

* The Docker CE package must be installed on the VM hosting the agent. 
For installation instructions, see 
** https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/
** https://getstart.blog/2018/03/24/docker-ce-installation-on-red-hat-7/



* Users should not install the Docker-client-xx or Docker-common-xx native RHEL Docker packages since these do not support the 'docker run cli' format that Cloud Secure supports. To uninstall this package, see: 
** https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/#install-from-a-package
* OpenJDK Java is required. See  https://openjdk.java.net/install/ for installation instructions.  
* The IBM Java package, found in some RHEL versions, must be uninstalled.
** Verify the Java version: yum info "java"
** $ sudo update-alternatives --remove "java" "/usr/lib/jvm/jdk[version]/bin/java" (NOTE: not sure about this command)
* The 'sudo su â€“' command is required for installation, running scripts, and uninstall.
