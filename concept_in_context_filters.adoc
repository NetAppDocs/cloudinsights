When configuring a widget on an asset's landing page, you can set filters to show only objects directly related to the current asset.

Many widgets on an asset landing page allow you to filter for only objects related to the current asset. In a filter drop-down, object types that displays a link icon image:LinkIcon.png[Link Icon] can be filtered to only display objects related to the current asset.

For example, on a Storage asset page, we can add a Bar Chart widget to show volumes with top IOPS on that storage. By default, when you add a widget, _all_ volumes in your environment are displayed. 

To show only volumes on the current storage asset, do the following:

.steps
. Open an asset page for any *Storage* asset. 
. Click *Edit* to open the asset page in Edit mode.
* Click *Add Widget* and select _Bar Chart_.
* Select *Volume* for the object type to display on the bar chart.

Only objects that have the link icon in the asset type drop-down can be linked
Confluence page with relationships tables - Also in Edwin's test plan.

Example: Storage asset page, includes table of volumes on that storage. I want to add a bar-chart to show volumes with top IOPS. When I add a bar chart, by default the chart includes ALL volumes.  If I click the link, only the volumes on that storage will show up.

Asset Pages now include tables (as in 7.3.x). Each table contains certain default columns
