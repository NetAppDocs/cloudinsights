When configuring a widget on an asset's landing page, you can set _in-context_ filters to show only objects directly related to the current asset. By default, when you add a widget, _all_ objects of the selected type in your environment are displayed. In-context filters allow you to display only the data relevant to your current asset.

On most asset landing pages, widgets allow you to filter for objects related to the current asset. In filter drop-downs, object types that display a link icon image:LinkIcon.png[Link Icon] can be filtered in-context to the current asset.

For example, on a Storage asset page, you can add a Bar Chart widget to show the top IOPS on internal volumes only on that storage. By default, when you add a widget, _all_ internal volumes in your environment are displayed. 

To show only internal volumes on the current storage asset, do the following:

.Steps
. Open an asset page for any *Storage* asset. 
. Click *Edit* to open the asset page in Edit mode.
. Click *Add Widget* and select _Bar Chart_.
. Select *Internal Volume* for the object type to display on the bar chart. Notice that the internal volume object type has a link icon image:LinkIcon.png[Link Icon] beside it. The "linked" icon is enabled by default.

. Choose _IOPS - Total_ and set any additional filters you like.
. Collapse the *Roll Up* field by clicking the [X] beside it. The *Show* field is displayed.
. Choose to show Top 10.
. Save the widget.

The bar chart shows only the internal volumes that reside on the current storage asset. 

The widget will be displayed on the asset pages for all storage objects. When the in-context link is enabled in the widget, the bar chart shows data for internal volumes related only to the currently-displayed storage asset.

To unlink the object data, edit the widget and click the link icon image:LinkIconEnabled.png[Link Icon Enabled] next to the object type. The link becomes disabled image:LinkIconDisabled.png[Link Icon Disabled] and the chart displays data for _all_ objects in your environment.

You can also use link:concept_dashboard_features.html#variables[*special variables in widgets*] to display asset-related information on landing pages.
