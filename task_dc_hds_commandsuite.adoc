The Hitachi Vantara Command Suite data collector supports the HiCommand Device Manager server. Cloud Insights communicates with the HiCommand Device Manager server using the standard HiCommand API.

== Terminology 

Cloud Insights acquires the following inventory information from the Hitachi Vantara Command Suite data collector. For each asset type acquired by Cloud Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Vendor/Model Term|Cloud Insights Term 
|PDEV|Disk
|Journal Pool|Disk Group
|Storage Array|Storage
|Port Controller|Storage Node
|Array Group, HDS Pool|Storage Pool
|Logical Unit, LDEV|Volume
|===

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collector. 

=== Storage

The following terms apply to objects or references that you might find on HDS storage asset landing pages. Many of these terms apply to other data collectors as well.

* Name – comes directly from HDS HiCommand Device Manager’s “name” attribute via the GetStorageArray XML API call
* Model - comes directly from HDS HiCommand Device Manager’s “arrayType” attribute via the GetStorageArray XML API call
* Vendor – HDS
* Family - comes directly from HDS HiCommand Device Manager’s “arrayFamily” attribute via the GetStorageArray XML API call
* IP – this is the management IP address of the array, not an exhaustive list of all IP addresses on the array
* Raw Capacity – a base2 value representing the sum of the total capacity of all disks in this system, regardless of disk role.

=== Storage Pool

The following terms apply to objects or references that you might find on HDS storage pool asset landing pages. Many of these terms apply to other data collectors as well.

* Type: The value here will be one of:
** RESERVED – if this pool is dedicated for purposes other than data volumes, i.e, journaling, snapshots
** Thin Provisioning – if this is a HDP pool
** Raid Group – you will not likely see these for a few reasons:
+
Cloud Insights takes a strong stance to avoid double counting capacity at all costs. On HDS, one typically needs to build Raid Groups from disks, create pool volumes on those Raid Groups, and construct pools (often HDP, but could be special purpose) from those pool volumes. If Cloud Insights reported both the underlying Raid Groups as is, as well as the Pools, the sum of their raw capacity would vastly exceed the sum of the disks.
+
Instead, Cloud Insights’ HDS Command Suite data collector arbitrarily shrinks the size of Raid Groups by the capacity of pool volumes. This may result in Cloud Insights not reporting the Raid Group at all. Additionally, any resulting Raid Groups are flagged in a way such that they are not visible in the Cloud Insights WebUI, but they do flow into the Cloud Insights Data Warehouse (DWH). The purpose of these decisions is to avoid UI clutter for things that most users do not care about – if your HDS array has Raid Groups with 50MB free, you probably cannot use that free space for any meaningful outcome.

* Node - N/A, as HDS pools are not tied to any one specific node
* Redundancy - the RAID level of the pool. Possibly multiple values for a HDP pool comprised of multiple RAID types
* Capacity % - the percent used of the pool for data usage, with the used GB and total logical GB size of the pool
* Over-committed Capacity - a derived value, stating “the logical capacity of this pool is oversubscribed by this percentage by virtue of the sum of the logical volumes exceeding the logical capacity of the pool by this percentage”
* Snapshot - shows the capacity reserved for snapshot usage on this pool

=== Storage Node

The following terms apply to objects or references that you might find on HDS storage node asset landing pages. Many of these terms apply to other data collectors as well.

* Name – The name of the Front-end director (FED) or Channel Adapter on monolithic arrays, or the name of the controller on a modular array. A given HDS array will have 2 or more Storage Nodes
* Volumes – The Volume table will show any volume mapped to any port owned by this storage node


== Inventory Requirements

You must have the following in order to collect inventory data:

* IP address of the HiCommand Device Manager server
* Read-only user name and password for the HiCommand Device Manager software and peer privileges
* Port requirements: 2001 (http) or 2443 (https)
* Log into HiCommand Device Manager software using username and password 
* Verify access to HiCommand Device Manager \http://<HiCommand_Device_Manager_IP>:2001/service/StorageManager 

== Performance requirements 

The following requirements must be met in order to collect performance data:

* HDS USP, USP V, and VSP performance 
** Performance Monitor must be licensed.
** Monitoring switch must be enabled. 
** The Export Tool (Export.exe) must be copied to the Cloud Insights AU.
** The Export Tool version must match the microcode version of the target array.

* AMS performance:
** NetApp strongly recommends creating a dedicated service account on AMS arrays for Cloud Insights to use to retrieve performance data. Storage Navigator only allows a user account one concurrent login to the array. Having Cloud Insights use the same user account as management scripts or HiCommand may result in Cloud Insights, management scripts, or HiCommand being unable to communicate to the array due to the one concurrent user account login limit
** Performance Monitor must be licensed.
** The Storage Navigator Modular 2 (SNM2) CLI utility needs to be installed on the Cloud Insights AU.
