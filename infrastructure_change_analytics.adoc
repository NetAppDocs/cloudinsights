Infrastructure Change Analytics provide you with an all-in-one view of recent changes to th einfrastructure (storage, switch, etc.) in your environment. With Change Analytics, you can track configuration changes and drill into both expected and unexpected issues.

How does Change Analysis help?

* In any environment, changes to your storage or devices may happen because of mis-configured changes, power loss, etc. Change Analytics help with this by providing a single pane to view and correlate the health of your devices with outages or planned changes. 


To analyze Infrastructure Changes, navigate to *Observability > Change Analysis*. Alerts and Configuration changes for the current time range (default 3 hours) are listed. Alert lines show the current alert status (active or resolved). Configuration changes also show current status.
