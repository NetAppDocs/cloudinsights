Insights alow you to investigate resource contntion and impact in your invironment. An "impactful" or "greedy" resource is on that causes a negative impact on another resource, for example, a volume experiencing very high IOPS may cause increased latency in other volumes (i.e. "impacted" or "degraded" resources). Greedy/degraded resources are “peers” that utilize the same shared resource. The greedy resource has IOPS or utilization rates that negatively impact the degraded resource's IOPS or latency.
