Cloud Insights uses this data collector to gather metrics from Kafka.

== Installation 

. From *Admin > Data Collectors*, click *+Data Collector*. Under *Services*, choose Kafka.
+
If you haven't configured an Agent for collection, you are prompted to link:task_config_telegraf_agent.html[install an agent] in your environment.
+
If you have an agent already configured, select the appropriate Operating System or Platform and click *Continue*.

. Follow the instructions in the Kafka Configuration screen to configure the data collector. The instructions vary depending on the type of Operating System or Platform you are using to collect data. The example below shows the instructions for Windows:

== Setup

The Kafka plugin is based on the telegraf's Jolokia plugin. As such as a requirement to gather info from all Kafka brokers, JMX needs to be configured and exposed via Jolokia on all components.

==== Compatibility
Configuration was developed against Kafka version 0.11.0.2.

==== Setting up
All the instructions below assume your install location for kafka is '/opt/kafka'. You can adapt instructions below to reflect your install location.

==== Jolokia Agent Jar
A version the Jolokia agent jar file must be link:https://jolokia.org/download.html[downloaded]. The version tested against was Jolokia agent 1.6.0. 

Instructions below assume that the downloaded jar file (jolokia-jvm-1.6.0-agent.jar) is placed under the location '/opt/kafka/libs/'.

==== Kafka Brokers
To configure Kafka Brokers to expose the Jolokia API, you can add the following in <KAFKA_HOME>/bin/kafka-server-start.sh, just before the 'kafka-run-class.sh' call:

----
export JMX_PORT=9999
export RMI_HOSTNAME=`hostname -I`
export KAFKA_JMX_OPTS="-javaagent:/opt/kafka/libs/jolokia-jvm-1.6.0-agent.jar=port=8778,host=0.0.0.0  -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.password.file=/opt/kafka/config/jmxremote.password -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.ssl=false -Djava.rmi.server.hostname=$RMI_HOSTNAME -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.rmi.port=$JMX_PORT"
----

Note that example above is using 'hostname -I' to setup the 'RMI_HOSTNAME' environment variable. In multiple IP machines, this will need to be tweaked to gather the IP you care about for RMI connections.

You can choose a different port for JMX (9999 above) and Jolokia (8778). If you have an internal IP to lock Jolokia onto you can replace the "catch all" 0.0.0.0 by your own IP. Notice this IP needs to be accessible from the telegraf plugin. You can use the option '-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote.authenticate=false' if you don't want to authenticate. Use at your own risk.
