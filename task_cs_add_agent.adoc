Cloud Secure collects user activity data using one or more agents. Agents connect to devices in your environment and collect data that is sent to the Cloud Secure SaaS layer for analysis. See link:concept_cs_agent_requirements.html[Agent Requirements] to configure an agent VM.

== Before You Begin

* The sudo privilege is required for installation, running scripts, and uninstall. 

////
* The Docker CE package must be installed on the VM hosting the agent. 
+ 
To determine if the Docker CE package is installed, use the following command:   
`sudo rpm -qa |grep -i docker-ce`
If the package is installed, the command returns the package name, for example:  
docker-ce-18.03.1.ce-1.el7.centos.x86_64

* The Docker-client-xx or Docker-common-xx native RHEL Docker packages are not supported. These packages do not support the `docker run cli` format that Cloud Secure supports. 
+ 
Use the following commands to determine if these packages are installed: 
`sudo rpm -qa | grep -i docker-client`
`sudo rpm -qa  |grep -i docker-common` 

== Steps to Install Docker

. Install the required dependencies:
`sudo yum install yum-utils device-mapper-persistent-data lvm2`

. Add docker stable repository to your system:
`sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo \https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/docker-ce.repo`

. To use the latest version of Docker CE, enable repositories that are disabled by default:
`sudo yum-config-manager --enable docker-ce-edge`

. Install the latest version of Docker CE using the following command:
`sudo yum install docker-ce`
(Version must be higher than 17.06)

. Start Docker
`sudo systemctl start docker`

. Use the following command to automatically start Docker on system reboot:
`sudo systemctl enable docker`

== Docker Installation Reference

For additional installation information, see: 
* https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/
* https://getstart.blog/2018/03/24/docker-ce-installation-on-red-hat-7/
//sysctl start docker

== Steps to Install Docker on a VM Without Full Access to the Internet

.Steps 
. Uninstall existing docker installation:
+
`sudo rpm -qa | grep docker`
`sudo rpm -e <rpms>`

. Install Docker-ce

.. Download all required rpms and copy them to the VM on which the agent is to be installed.

== Java Requirement 

OpenJDK Java is required. Use the following command to determine if OpenJDK Java is installed: 
`sudo rpm -qa|grep -i openjdk`  

Install OpenJDK Java using the following command: 
`sudo yum install -y java-1.8.0-openjdk`

The IBM Java package, found in some RHEL versions, must be uninstalled. Use the following command to verify the Java version: 
`sudo java -` (or) `sudo rpm -qa | grep -I java`
If the command returns information similar to 'IBM J9 VM (build 2.9.x)' you need to remove the package: 
`sudo update-alternatives --remove java /usr/lib/jvm/jdk[version]/bin/java`
////

////
== Steps to Install an Agent from a Non-Root Account

You can perform an installation from a non-Root user account using the following steps:

. Add a local user and set the password: (where username is the name you choose)
 `sudo useradd username` 
 `sudo passwd username password` (enter the password for the local user)

. Uncomment the following lines in /etc/sudoers

* %wheel ALL=(ALL) ALL
* %wheel ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

. Add the local user you created to the wheel group: 
 `sudo usermod -aG wheel username`

. Create an installation folder in the local user's home directory and install the Cloud Secure Agent from within the folder:
 `sudo cd /home/username/`
 `sudo mkdir install; cd install/`

. Install the Cloud Secure Agent using the Curl command taken from the Web UI. 
+
Provide a -k in the Curl command if your RHEL platform performs a strict certificate check. For CentOS systems, the -k option is not required.

== Files Created During Installation

* Installation directory: 
+
/opt/netapp/cloudsecure/agent

* Installation logs: 
+
/var/log/netapp/cloudsecure/install
/opt/netapp/cloud-secure/logs 

* Agent Logs:         

* You can use the following command to verify the agent installed correctly: 
`sudo grep -irn register /opt/netapp/cloudsecure/agent/logs/agent.log`

//* Use the following script to control the Cloud Secure service:
//`sudo cloud-secure-agent-service.sh --help`

* Use the following script to uninstall the agent:
`sudo cloudsecure-agent-uninstall.sh`
////

== Network Configuration

Run the following commands on the local system to open ports that will be used by Cloud Secure. If there is a security concern regarding the port range, you can use a lesser port range, for example _35000:35100_. Each SVM uses two ports. 

.Steps

. `sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=35000-55000/tcp` 
. `sudo firewall-cmd --reload` 

Follow the next steps according to your platform:

*CentOS 7.x / RHEL 7.x*:

. `sudo iptables-save | grep 35000` 

Sample output:

 -A IN_public_allow -p tcp -m tcp --dport 35000:55000 -m conntrack -ctstate NEW,UNTRACKED -j ACCEPT

*CentOS 8.x / RHEL 8.x*:

. `sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --list-ports | grep 35000` (for CentOS 8)

Sample output:

 35000-55000/tcp


== Troubleshooting Agent Errors

Known problems and their resolutions are described in the following table. 

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"30,70"]

|===
|Problem: | Resolution:

|Agent installation fails to create the /opt/netapp/cloudsecure/agent/logs/agent.log folder and the install.log file provides no relevant information.|This error occurs during bootstrapping of the agent. The error is not logged in log files because it occurs before logger is initialized. 
The error is redirected to standard output, and is visible in the service log using the `journalctl -u cloudsecure-agent.service` command. This command can be used for troubleshooting the issue further.

|Agent installation fails with ‘This linux distribution is not supported. Exiting the installation’.|The supported platforms for Cloud Secure 1.0.0 are RHEL 7.x / CentOS 7.x. Ensure that you are not installing the agent on a RHEL 6.x or CentOS 6.x system.

|Agent Installation failed with the error: 
"-bash: unzip: command not found"
|Install unzip and then run the installation command again. If Yum is installed on the machine, try “yum install unzip” to install unzip software. 
After that, re-copy the command from the Agent installation UI and paste it in the CLI to execute the installation again.

|Agent was installed and was running. However agent has stopped suddenly.
|SSH to the Agent machine. Check the status of the agent service via `sudo systemctl status cloudsecure-agent.service`. 
1. Check if the logs shows a message“Failed to start Cloud Secure daemon service” . 
2. Check if cssys user exists in the Agent machine or not. Execute the following commands one by one with root permission and check if the cssys user and group exists. 
`sudo id cssys`
`sudo groups cssys`
3. If none exists, then a centralized monitoring policy may have deleted the cssys user.
4. Create cssys user and group manually by executing the following commands.
`sudo useradd cssys`
`sudo groupadd cssys`
5. Restart the agent service after that by executing the following command:
`sudo systemctl restart cloudsecure-agent.service`
6. If it is still not running, please check the other troubleshooting options.

|Unable to add more than 50 Data collectors to an Agent.
|Only 50 Data collectors can be added to an Agent. This can be a combination of all the collector types, for example, Active Directory, SVM and other collectors.

|UI shows Agent is in NOT_CONNECTED state.
|Steps to restart the Agent.
1. SSH to the Agent machine.
2. Restart the agent service after that by executing the following command:
`sudo systemctl restart cloudsecure-agent.service`
3. Check the status of the agent service via `sudo systemctl status cloudsecure-agent.service`.
4. Agent should go to CONNECTED state.

|Agent VM is behind Zscaler proxy and the agent installation is failing. Because of Zscaler proxy’s SSL inspection, the Cloud Secure certificates are presented as it is signed by Zscaler CA so the agent is not trusting the communication.
|Disable SSL inspection in the Zscaler proxy for the *.cloudinsights.netapp.com url. If Zscaler does SSL inspection and replaces the certificates, Cloud Secure will not work.

|While installing the agent, the installation hangs after unzipping.
|“chmod 755 -Rf” command is failing. 
The command fails when the agent installation command is being run by a non-root sudo user that has files in the working directory, belonging to another user, and permissions of those files cannot be changed. Because of the failing chmod command, the rest of the installation does not execute.

1.	Create a new directory named “cloudsecure”.
2.	Go to that directory.
3.	Copy and paste the full “token=…… … ./cloudsecure-agent-install.sh" installation command and press enter.
4.	Installation should be able to proceed.

|If the Agent is still not able to connect to Saas, please open a case with NetApp Support. Provide the Cloud Insights serial number to open a case, and attach logs to the case as noted.
|To attach logs to the case:
 1.	Execute the following script with root permission and share the output file (cloudsecure-agent-symptoms.zip).
    a.	/opt/netapp/cloudsecure/agent/bin/cloudsecure-agent-symptom-collector.sh
 2.	Execute the following commands one by one with root permission and share the output.
    a.	id cssys
    b.	groups cssys
    c.	cat /etc/os-release
