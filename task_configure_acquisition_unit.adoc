An Acquisition Unit is a server or virtual machine that you configure to collect data from devices in the data center using modules called Data Collectors. You must install at least one Acquisition Unit in order to begin collecting data. 

You can add a LINUX Acquisition Unit using the following steps:

* If you do not have at least one data collector configured, go to *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition Units* and choose one from the choices displayed.

* You can also click on *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition Unit + Acquisition Unit* 
 * and select the _Acquisition Units_ page. 
+
In both cases, the *Add Acquisition Unit* dialog is displayed.
