Cloud Insights collects device data using one or more Acquisition Units installed on local servers. Each Acquisition Unit can host multiple Data Collectors, which send device metrics to Cloud Insights for analysis. 

This topic describes how to add Acquisition Units and describes additional steps required when your environment uses a proxy. 

== Adding a Linux Acquisition Unit

.Before you begin

* If your system is using a proxy, you must set the proxy environment variables before the acquisition unit is installed. For more information, see <<Setting proxy environment variables>>.
* You must have an unzip program to unzip the downloaded files.

.Steps for Linux Acquisition Unit Installation 

. Log in as Administrator or Account Owner to your Cloud Insights environment. 
. Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition Units > +Acquisition Unit* 
+
The system displays the _Add Acquisition Unit_ dialog. Choose Linux.

. Verify that the server or VM hosting the Acquisition Unit meets the minimum system requirements. 
. Verify that the server is running a supported version of Linux, click _Versions Supported (i)_.

. Copy the Installation command displayed in the dialog into a terminal window on the server or VM that will host the Acquisition unit.  
. Execute the command in the Bash shell. 

.After you finish

* Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition units* to check the status of Acquisition Units. 
* You can access the Acquisition Unit logs at /var/log/netapp/cloudinsights/acq/acq.log
* Use the following script to control the Acquisition Unit:
** cloudinsights-service.sh (stop, start, restart, check the status)
* Use the following script to uninstall the Acquisition Unit:
** cloudinsights-uninstall.sh

=== Setting proxy environment variables

For environments that use a proxy, you must set the proxy environment variables before you add the Acquisition Unit. The instructions for configuring the proxy are provided on the _Add Acquisition Unit_  dialog. 

. Click + in Have a Proxy Server?
. Copy the commands to a text editor and set your proxy variables as needed.
+ Note: Restrictions on special characters in proxy username and password fields:  '%' and '!' are allowed in the  username filed. ':', '%', and '!' are allowed in the password field. 
. Run the edited command in a terminal using the Bash shell.
. Install the Acquisition Unit software.




== Adding a Windows Acquisition Unit

.Steps for Windows Acquisition Unit Installation 

. Log in to the Acquisition Unit server/VM as a user with Administrator permissions.
. On that server, open a browser window and log in to your Cloud Insights environment as Administrator or Account Owner. 
. Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition Units > +Acquisition Unit* .
+
The system displays the _Add Acquisition Unit_ dialog. Choose Windows.

. Verify that the server or VM hosting the Acquisition Unit meets the minimum system requirements. 
. Verify that the server is running a supported version of Windows click _Versions Supported (i)_.

. Click the *Download Installer (Windows 64-bit)* button. 

. Copy the Installation command snippet in the dialog and paste it into a command prompt window on the Acquisition Unit server. You can click the clipboard icon to copy the full command to the clipboard.
+
The snippet installs the Acquisition Unit software on the server. 

.After you finish

* Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition units* to check the status of Acquisition Units. 
* You can access the Acquisition Unit log in <install dir>\Cloud Insights\Acquisition Unit\log\acq.log

* Use the following script to control the Acquisition Unit:
** cloudinsights-service.sh (stop, start, restart, check the status)
* Use the following script to uninstall the Acquisition Unit:
** cloudinsights-uninstall.sh
