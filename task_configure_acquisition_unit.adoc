An Acquisition Unit is a server or virtual machine that you configure to collect data from devices in the data center using modules called Data Collectors. You must install at least one Acquisition Unit in order to begin collecting data. 

You can add an Acquisition Unit from  either of these places:

* If you do not have at least one data collector configured, go to *Admin > Data Collectors* and choose one from the choices displayed.

* You can also click on *Admin > Data Collectors* and select the _Acquisition Units_ page. Click on the *+Acquisition Unit* button.
+
In both cases, the *Add Acquisition Unit* dialog is displayed.
