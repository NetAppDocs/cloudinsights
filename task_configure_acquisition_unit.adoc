[.lead]

Cloud Insights collects device data using one or more Acquisition Units installed on local servers. Each Acquisition Unit can host multiple Data Collectors, which send device metrics to Cloud Insights for analysis. 

This topic describes how to add Acquisition Units and describes additional steps required when your environment uses a proxy. 

NOTE: For accurate audit and data reporting, it is strongly recommended to synchronize the time on the Acquisition Unit machine using *Network Time Protocol (NTP)* or *Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)*.

== Adding a Linux Acquisition Unit

.Before you begin

* If your system is using a proxy, you must set the proxy environment variables before the acquisition unit is installed. For more information, see <<Setting proxy environment variables>>.
// * You must have an unzip program to unzip the downloaded files.

.Steps for Linux Acquisition Unit Installation 

. Log in as Administrator or Account Owner to your Cloud Insights environment. 
. Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition Units > +Acquisition Unit* 
+
The system displays the _Install Acquisition Unit_ dialog. Choose Linux.

. Verify that the server or VM hosting the Acquisition Unit meets the recommended system requirements. 
. Verify that the server is running a supported version of Linux. Click _OS Versions Supported (i)_ for a list of supported versions.

. Copy the Installation command snippet in the dialog into a terminal window on the server or VM that will host the Acquisition unit.  
. Paste and execute the command in the Bash shell. 

.After you finish

* Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition units* to check the status of Acquisition Units. 
* You can access the Acquisition Unit logs at /var/log/netapp/cloudinsights/acq/acq.log
* Use the following script to control the Acquisition Unit:
** cloudinsights-service.sh (stop, start, restart, check the status)
* Use the following script to uninstall the Acquisition Unit:
** cloudinsights-uninstall.sh

=== Setting proxy environment variables

For environments that use a proxy, you must set the proxy environment variables before you add the Acquisition Unit. The instructions for configuring the proxy are provided on the _Add Acquisition Unit_  dialog. 

. Click + in _Have a Proxy Server?_

. Copy the commands to a text editor and set your proxy variables as needed.
+ 
Note: Be aware of restrictions on special characters in proxy username and password fields: '%' and '!' are allowed in the username field. ':', '%', and '!' are allowed in the password field. 

. Run the edited command in a terminal using the Bash shell.

. Install the Acquisition Unit software.

=== Proxy Configuration

The Acquisition Unit uses 2-way/mutual authentication to connect to the Cloud Insights server. The client certificate must be passed to the Cloud Insights server to be authenticated. To accomplish this, the proxy must be set up to forward the https request to the Cloud Insights server without decrypting the data.

The simplest way to do this is to specify wildcard configuration in your proxy/firewall to communicate with Cloud Insights, for example:

 *.cloudinsights.netapp.com

NOTE: The use of an asterisk (*) for wildcard is common, but your proxy/firewall configuration may use a different format. Check with your proxy documentation to ensure correct wildcard specification in your environment.

==== Viewing Proxy URLs

You can view your proxy endpoint URLs by clicking the *Proxy Settings* link when choosing a data collector during onboarding, or the link under _Proxy Settings_ on the *Help > Support* page. A table like the following is displayed.

image:ProxyEndpoints_NewTable.png[Proxy Endpoints Table]

If you have Cloud Secure in your environment, the configured endpoint URLs will also be displayed in this list.

////
* Acquisition unit login endpoint: _aulogin.<Cloud Insights Domain>_
* Cloud Insights site: _<Site Name>.<Cloud Insights Domain>_
 
For example:
 
 https://aulogin.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com
 https://nane1234.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com

TIP: The Cloud Insights _Site Name_ is also sometimes called the _Tenant_.

== Adding a Windows Acquisition Unit

.Steps for Windows Acquisition Unit Installation 

. Log in to the Acquisition Unit server/VM as a user with Administrator permissions.
. On that server, open a browser window and log in to your Cloud Insights environment as Administrator or Account Owner. 
. Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition Units > +Acquisition Unit* .
+
The system displays the _Install Acquisition Unit_ dialog. Choose Windows.

[.thumb]
image::NewWindowsAUInstall.png[Windows AU Install]

. Verify that the server or VM hosting the Acquisition Unit meets the recommended system requirements. 
. Verify that the server is running a supported version of Windows. Click _OS Versions Supported (i)_ for a list of supported versions.

. Click the *Download Installer (Windows 64-bit)* button. 

. Copy the Access Key. You will need this during the Installation.

. On the Acquisition Unit server/VM, execute the downloaded installer.

. Paste the Access Key into the installation wizard when prompted.

. During installation, you will be presented with the opportunity to provide your proxy server settings.

.After you finish

* Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition units* to check the status of Acquisition Units. 
* You can access the Acquisition Unit log in <install dir>\Cloud Insights\Acquisition Unit\log\acq.log

* Use the following script to stop, start, restart, or check the status of the Acquisition Unit:
+
 cloudinsights-service.sh 
 
//* Use the following script to uninstall the Acquisition Unit:

//** cloudinsights-uninstall.sh
