Cloud Insights collects device data using one or more Acquisition Units installed on local servers. Each Acquisition Unit can host multiple Data Collectors, which send device metrics to Cloud Insights for analysis. 

This topic describes how to add Acquisition Units and describes additional steps required when your environment uses a proxy. 

== Adding a Linux Acquisition Unit

.Before you begin

* If your system is using a proxy, you must set the proxy environment variables before the acquisition unit is installed. For more information, see <<Setting proxy environment variables>>.
// * You must have an unzip program to unzip the downloaded files.

.Steps for Linux Acquisition Unit Installation 

. Log in as Administrator or Account Owner to your Cloud Insights environment. 
. Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition Units > +Acquisition Unit* 
+
The system displays the _Install Acquisition Unit_ dialog. Choose Linux.

. Verify that the server or VM hosting the Acquisition Unit meets the recommended system requirements. 
. Verify that the server is running a supported version of Linux. Click _OS Versions Supported (i)_ for a list of supported versions.

. Copy the Installation command displayed in the dialog into a terminal window on the server or VM that will host the Acquisition unit.  
. Paste and execute the command in the Bash shell. 

.After you finish

* Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition units* to check the status of Acquisition Units. 
* You can access the Acquisition Unit logs at /var/log/netapp/cloudinsights/acq/acq.log
* Use the following script to control the Acquisition Unit:
** cloudinsights-service.sh (stop, start, restart, check the status)
* Use the following script to uninstall the Acquisition Unit:
** cloudinsights-uninstall.sh

=== Setting proxy environment variables

For environments that use a proxy, you must set the proxy environment variables before you add the Acquisition Unit. The instructions for configuring the proxy are provided on the _Add Acquisition Unit_  dialog. 

. Click + in Have a Proxy Server?
. Copy the commands to a text editor and set your proxy variables as needed.
+ Note: Restrictions on special characters in proxy username and password fields:  '%' and '!' are allowed in the  username filed. ':', '%', and '!' are allowed in the password field. 
. Run the edited command in a terminal using the Bash shell.
. Install the Acquisition Unit software.

=== Proxy Configuration

The Acquisition Unit uses 2-way/mutual authentication to connect to the Cloud Insights server. The client certificate must be passed to the Cloud Insights server to be authenticated. To accomplish this, the proxy must be set up to forward the http request to the Cloud Insights server without decrypting the data.

The Acquisition Unit uses the following two endpoints to communicate with Cloud Insights. If you have a firewall between the Acquisition Unit server and Cloud Insights, you need these endpoints when configuring firewall rules:

 https://aulogin.<Cloud Insights Domain>
 https://<your-tenant-ID>.<Cloud Insights Domain>
 
For example:
 
 https://aulogin.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com
 https://cg0c586a-ee05-45rb-a5ac-333b5ae7718d7.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com


////
 https://aulogin.<domain>
 https://<tenantUUID>.<domain>

The second URL can be found in the acq.log, which is located at the following location.

 Windows: <installation location>/Cloud Insights/Acquisition Unit/log/acq.log
 Linux: /var/log/netapp/cloudinsights/acq/acq.log

The URl can be found by searching the .log for “Attempting to verify server at: https://<tenantUUID>.oci.cloud.netapp.com”
////

== Adding a Windows Acquisition Unit

.Steps for Windows Acquisition Unit Installation 

. Log in to the Acquisition Unit server/VM as a user with Administrator permissions.
. On that server, open a browser window and log in to your Cloud Insights environment as Administrator or Account Owner. 
. Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition Units > +Acquisition Unit* .
+
The system displays the _Install Acquisition Unit_ dialog. Choose Windows.

. Verify that the server or VM hosting the Acquisition Unit meets the recommended system requirements. 
. Verify that the server is running a supported version of Windows. Click _OS Versions Supported (i)_ for a list of supported versions.

. Click the *Download Installer (Windows 64-bit)* button. 

. Copy the key in the dialog. You can click the clipboard icon to quickly copy it to the clipboard.

. Paste the key into the installation wizard when prompted.

. If your environment uses a proxy, you will be prompted to enter your proxy environment information in the installation wizard.

.After you finish

* Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition units* to check the status of Acquisition Units. 
* You can access the Acquisition Unit log in <install dir>\Cloud Insights\Acquisition Unit\log\acq.log

* Use the following script to stop, start, restart, or check the status of the Acquisition Unit:
+
 cloudinsights-service.sh 
 
//* Use the following script to uninstall the Acquisition Unit:

//** cloudinsights-uninstall.sh

=== Proxy Configuration

The Acquisition Unit uses 2-way/mutual authentication to connect to the Cloud Insights server. The client certificate must be passed to the Cloud Insights server to be authenticated. To accomplish this, the proxy must be set up to forward the http request to the Cloud Insights server without decrypting the data.

The Acquisition Unit uses the following two endpoints to communicate with Cloud Insights. If you have a firewall between the Acquisition Unit server and Cloud Insights, you need these endpoints when configuring firewall rules:

 https://aulogin.<Cloud Insights Domain>
 https://<your-tenant-ID>.<Cloud Insights Domain>
 
For example:
 
 https://aulogin.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com
 https://cg0c586a-ee05-45rb-a5ac-333b5ae7718d7.c01.cloudinsights.netapp.com



== Uninstalling an Acquisition Unit

To uninstall the Acquisition Unit software, do the following:

*Windows:*

. On the Acquisition Unit server/VM, open Control Panel and choose *Uninstall a Program*. Select the Cloud Insights Acquisition Unit program for removal.
. Click Uninstall and follow the prompts.

*Linux:*

. On the Acquisition Unit server/VM, run the following command: 

 sudo cloudinsights-uninstall.sh -p
 
. For help with uninstall, run: 

 sudo cloudinsights-uninstall.sh --help

*Both:*

. After uninstalling the AU software, go to *Admin > Data Collectors* and select the *Acquisition Units* tab.
. Click the Options button to the right of the Acquisition Unit you wish to uninstall, and select _Delete_. You can delete an Acquisition Unit only if there are no data collectors assigned to it.



== Reinstalling an Acquisition Unit

To re-install an Acquisition Unit on the same server/VM, you must follow these steps:

.Before you begin

You must have a temporary Acquisition Unit configured on a separate server/VM before re-installing an Acquisition Unit.

.Steps
. Log in to the Acquisition Unit server/VM and uninstall the AU software.
. Log into your Cloud Insights environment and go to *Admin > Data Collectors*. 
. For each data collector, click the Options menu on the right and select _Edit_. Assign the data collector to the temporary Acquisition Unit and click *Save*.
+
You can also select multiple data collectors of the same type and click the *Bulk Actions* button. Choose _Edit_ and assign the data collectors to the temporary Acquisition Unit.

. After all of the data collectors have been moved to the temporary Acquisition Unit, go to *Admin > Data Collectors* and select the *Acquisition Units* tab.

. Click the Options button to the right of the Acquisition Unit you wish to re-install, and select _Delete_. You can delete an Acquisition Unit only if there are no data collectors assigned to it.

. You can now re-install the Acquisition Unit software on the original server/VM. Click *+Acquisition Unit* and follow the instructions above to install the Acquisition Unit.  

. Once the Acquisition Unit has been re-installed, assign your data collectors back to the Acquisition Unit.
