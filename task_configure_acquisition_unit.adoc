An Acquisition Unit is a server or virtual machine that you configure to collect data from devices in the data center using modules called Data Collectors. You must add at least one Acquisition Unit in order to begin collecting data. 

This procedure describes how to add Acquisition Units and describes additional steps required when your environment uses a proxy. 

== Setting proxy environment variables

For environments that use a proxy, you must set the proxy environment variables before you add the Acquisition Unit. The instructions for configuring the proxy are provided on the _Add Acquisition Unit_  dialog. 

. Click + in Have a Proxy Server?
. Copy the commands to a text editor and set your proxy variables as needed.
. Run the edited command in a terminal.
. Install the Acquisition Unit software.

== Adding a Linux Acquisition Unit

.Before you begin

* If your system is using a proxy, you must set the proxy environment variables before the acquisition unit is installed. For more information, see <<Setting proxy environment variables>>. 

.Steps for Linux Acquisition Unit Installation 

. Log in as Administrator or Account Owner to your Cloud Insights environment. 
. Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition Units > +Acquisition Unit* 
+
The system displays the _Add Acquisition Unit_ dialog.

. Click *LINUX*

* Verify that the server or VM hosting the Acquisition Unit meets the minimum system requirements. 
* Verify that the server is running a supported version of Linux.

. Copy the Installation command displayed in the dialog into a terminal window on the server or VM that will host the Acquisition unit.  
+
You can click on the _Copy to Clipboard_ icon to easily copy the command from the dialog.

. Execute the command. 

The command contains a key unique to your environment that is good for 24 hours and for a single Acquisition Unit only. 

.After you finish

* Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Acquisition units* to check the status of Acquisition Units. 
* You can access the Acquisition Unit logs at /var/netapp/oci/acq/acq.log

== Installing a Windows Acquisition Unit

//.Before you begin

//* If your system is using a proxy, you must set the proxy environment variables before the acquisition unit is installed. For more information, see <<Setting proxy environment variables>>. 

//.Steps for Windows Acquisition Unit 

//. Log in as Administrator or Account Owner to your Cloud Insights environment. 
// . Open the *Add Acquisition Unit* dialog by either of the methods above.
//. Choose *Windows*.  
//. Verify that your server or VM meets the minimum requirements shown. You can view more detailed Acquisition Unit requirements link:concept_acquisition_unit_requirements.html[here].
//. Verify your server or VM is running one of the supported operating system versions.

//. REMAINING STEPS TBD

.After you finish
