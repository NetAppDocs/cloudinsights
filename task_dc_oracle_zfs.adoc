Data Infrastructure Insights uses the Oracle ZFS Storage Appliance data collector to gather inventory and performance data.   

== Terminology

Data Infrastructure Insights acquires inventory information with the Oracle ZFS data collector. For each asset type acquired by Data Infrastructure Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Vendor/Model Term | Data Infrastructure Insights Term
|Disk (SSD)|Disk
|Cluster|Storage
|Controller|Storage Node
|LUN|Volume
|LUN Map|Volume Map
|Initiator,Target|Volume Mask
|Share|Internal Volume
|===

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data source.

== Requirements

* Host names for the ZFS Controller-1 and the ZFS Controller-2 
* Administrator user name and password
* Port requirement: 215 HTTP/HTTPS

== Required Performance metrics

Oracle ZFS appliances give storage administators large amounts of flexibility to capture performance statistics. Data Infrastructure Insights expects you to have _each_ controller in a high availability pair configured to capture the following metrics: 

* smb2.ops[share] 
* nfs3.ops[share]
* nfs4.ops[share]
* nfs4-1.ops[share]

Failure to have the controller capture any or all of these will likely result in Data Infrastructure Insights not having, or underreporting, the workload on the "Internal Volumes".
 
== Configuration

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Field | Description
|ZFS Controller-1 Hostname|Host name for storage controller 1 
|ZFS Controller-2 Hostname|Host name for storage controller 2 
|User name|User name for the storage system administrator user account
|Password|Password for the administrator user account
|===

== Advanced configuration 

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Field | Description
|Connection Type |HTTPS or HTTP, also displays the default port
|Override Connection Port |If blank, use the default port in the Connection Type field, otherwise enter the connection port to use
|Inventory poll interval|The default is 60 seconds
|Performance Poll Interval (sec)|The default is 300.

== Troubleshooting
Some things to try if you encounter problems with this data collector:

=== Inventory

[cols="2a, 2a", options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:
|"Invalid login credentials" 
|validate Zfs user account and password 
|"Configuration error" with error message “REST Service is disabled”
|Verify REST service is enabled on this device.
|"Configuration error " with error message “User unauthorized for command”
|This error is likely due to certain roles (for example, 'advanced_analytics') not being included for the configured user.

Applying the Analytics scope for the user with read-only role may remove the error. Follow these steps:

. On the ZFs system, from the Configuration -> Users screen, move your mouse over the role and double click to allow editing

. Select "Analytics" from the Scope drop down menu. A list of the possible properties appears.

. Click the top most check box and it will select all three properties.

. Click the Add button on the right side.

. Click the Apply button at the top right of the pop-up window. The pop-up window will close.
