The Cloud Insights Kubernetes Explorer is a powerful tool for displaying the overall health and usage of your Kubernetes clusters, and allows you to easily view and explore your cluster namespaces.

Clicking on a namespace link on any Kubernetes Explorer page will open a detail page for that namespace.

Like other Kubernetes Excplorer pages, you can set a filter to focus on specific nodes or other objects, and you can see an overview of pod health and namespace status, along with charts showing CPU and Memory demand as well as persistent volume capacity if applicable.

Finally, the page displays a table of workloads associated with the namespace.
