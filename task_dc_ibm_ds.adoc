The IBM DS (CLI) data collector supports inventory and performance data acquisition for DS6xxx and DS8xxx devices.

DS3xxx, DS4xxx, and DS5xxx devices are supported by the link:task_dc_na_eseries.html[NetApp E-Series data collector]. You should refer to the Data Infrastructure Insights support matrix for supported models and firmware versions.

== Terminology

Data Infrastructure Insights acquires the following inventory information from the IBM DS data collector. For each asset type acquired by Data Infrastructure Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:


[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Vendor/Model Term|Data Infrastructure Insights Term 
|Disk Drive Module|Disk
|Storage Image|Storage
|Extent Pool|Storage Node
|Fixed Block Volume|Volume
|Host FC Initiator (Mapped)|Volume Mask
|===

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collecor. 

== Requirements 

You need the following to configure this data collector:

* IP address of each DS array
* Read-only username and password on each DS array
* Third-party software installed on the Data Infrastructure Insights AU: IBM _dscli_
* Access validation: Run _dscli_ commands using the username and password
* Port requirements: 80, 443, & 1750 

== Configuration

|Field|Description
|Inventory Poll Interval (min) |Interval between inventory polls (min). The default is 40.
|Storage Display Name| Name of the IBM DS storage array
|Inventory Exclude Devices|Comma-separated list of device serial numbers to exclude from inventory collection
|Performance Poll Interval (sec)|The default is 300.
|Performance Filter Type|Include: Data collected only from devices on list. Exclude: No data from these devices is collected

== Troubleshooting
Some things to try if you encounter problems with this data collector:

=== Inventory

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:
|Error containing: CMUC00192E, CMUC00191E or CMUC00190E
|* Verify credentials and IP address entered.
* Try to communicate with the array through web management console \https://<ip>:8452/DS8000/Console.  Replace <ip> with data collector configured IP.
|Error:
* Cannot run program
* Error executing command
|* From Data Infrastructure Insights Acquisition Unit Open a CMD
* Open CLI.CFG file in CLI's home dir/lib and check property JAVA_INSTALL, edit the value to match your environment
* Display Java version installed on this machine, typing: "java -version"
* Ping the IP address of the IBM Storage device specified in CLI command issued.
* If all the above worked fine then manually run a CLI command
