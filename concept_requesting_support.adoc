NetApp provides support for Cloud Insights in a variety of ways. Extensive free self-support options are available 24x7, such as knowledgebase (KB) articles or the NetApp community. Customers with a paid Cloud Insights subscription can contact our knowledgeable Support Engineers via chat, phone, or web ticket.

You can access support options in Cloud Insights by clicking on *Help > Support*. The support options available to you depend on whether you are in Trial mode or Subscription mode.

== Subscription Support

In addition to the self-support options above, if you have a Cloud Insights paid subscription, you can work with a NetApp Support Engineer to resolve your problem.  

NOTE: You must register in order to activate support for NetApp Cloud products. To register, go to NetApp's link:https://register.netapp.com[Cloud Data Services Support Registration].

It is highly recommended that you check the box to allow a NetApp Support Engineer access to your Cloud Insights environment during your support session. This will allow the engineer to troubleshoot the problem and help you resolve it quickly. When your issue is resolved or your support session has ended, you can un-check the box. 

You can request support by any of the following methods. You must have an active Cloud Insights subscription to use these support options:
