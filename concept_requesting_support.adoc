== Activating support entitlement



Data Infrastructure Insights offers self-service and email support when running in trial mode. Once you have subscribed to the service, it is strongly recommended that you activate support entitlement. Activating support entitlement enables you to access technical support over the online chat, the web ticketing system, and the phone. The default support mode is self-service until registration is completed. See <<obtaining-support-information,details>> below.

During the initial subscription process, your Data Infrastructure Insights instance will generate a 20-digit NetApp serial number starting with "950". This NetApp serial number represents the Data Infrastructure Insights subscription associated with your account. You must register the NetApp serial number to activate support entitlement. We offer two options for support registration: 

. User with pre-existing NetApp Support Site (NSS) SSO account (e.g. current NetApp customer)
. New NetApp customer with no pre-existing NetApp Support Site (NSS) SSO account 

=== Option 1: Steps for a user with a pre-existing NetApp Support Site (NSS) SSO account 

.Steps

. Navigate to the NetApp registration website https://register.netapp.com

. Select “I am already registered as NetApp Customer” and choose _Data Infrastructure Insights_ as the Product Line. Select your Billing Provider (NetApp or AWS) and provide your Serial Number and your NetApp Subscription Name or AWS Customer ID by referring to the “Help > Support” menu within the Data Infrastructure Insights user interface:
