== Activating support entitlement

//Once you have access to Cloud Insights Service shortly after subscribing in the AWS marketplace, it is strongly recommended that you activate support entitlement. Activating support entitlement enables you to access technical support over online chat, web ticketing system, and phone. The default support level is self-service until registration is completed.

Cloud Insights offers self-service and email support when running in trial mode. Once you have subscribed to the service, it is strongly recommended that you activate support entitlement. Activating support entitlement enables you to access technical support over the online chat, the web ticketing system, and the phone. The default support mode is self-service until registration is completed. See link:#obtaining-support-information[details] below.

During the initial subscription process, your Cloud Insights instance will generate a 20-digit NetApp serial number starting with "950". This NetApp serial number represents the Cloud Insights subscription associated with your account. You must register the NetApp serial number to activate support entitlement. We offer two options for support registration: 

. User with pre-existing NetApp Support Site (NSS) SSO account (e.g. current NetApp customer)
. New NetApp customer with no pre-existing NetApp Support Site (NSS) SSO account 

=== Option 1: Steps for a user with a pre-existing NetApp Support Site (NSS) SSO account 

.Steps

. Navigate to the NetApp registration website https://register.netapp.com

. Select “I am already registered as NetApp Customer” and choose _Cloud Insights_ as the Product Line. Select your Billing Provider (NetApp or AWS) and provide your Serial Number and your NetApp Subscription Name or AWS Customer ID by referring to the “Help > Support” menu within the Cloud Insights user interface:
