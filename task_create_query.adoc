Queries enable you to search the assets in your environment at a granular level, allowing to filter for the data you want and sort the results to your liking.

For example, you can create a query for _volumes_, add a filter to find particular _storages_ associated with the selected volumes, add another filter to find a particular _annotation_ such as "Tier 1" on the selected storages, and finally add another filter to find all storages with _IOPS - Read (IO/s)_ greater than 25. When the results are displayed, you can then sort the columns of information associated with the query in ascending or descending order.

Note: When a new data collector is added which acquires assets, or any annotation or application assignments are made, you can query for those new assets, annotations, or applications after the queries are indexed. Indexing occurs at a regularly scheduled interval or during certain events such as running annotation rules.

Creating a Query is very simple:

. Navigate to *Queries > New Query* and click *+Query*

. From the 'Search for' list, select the asset/metric type you want to query for.

You can add filters to further narrow down your query by clicking the *+* button in the *Filter By* field. When working with integration data (Kubernetes, ONTAP Advanced Metrics, etc.), you can also add one or more groupings for the data, if desired.

The query results list shows a number of default columns, depending on the asset or metric type searched for. To add, remove, or change the columns, click the gear icon on the right of the table. The available columns varies based on the asset/metric type.
