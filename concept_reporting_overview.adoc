* Run a pre-defined report
* Create a custom report
* Customize the report format and delivery method
* Schedule reports to run automatically
* Email reports
* Use colors to represent thresholds on data

// Pre-defined reports are the standard Cloud Insights reports. This guide describes the pre-defined reports that are available with all of the product licenses.
