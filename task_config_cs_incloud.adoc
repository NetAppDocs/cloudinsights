Cloud Secure uses data collectors to collect file and user access data from devices.



== Cloud Volumes ONTAP Storage Configuration

See the OnCommand Cloud Manager Documentation to configure a single-node / HA AWS instance to host the Cloud Secure Agent: 
 https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/occm/index.html

After the configuration is complete, follow the steps to setup your SVM: 
 https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/task_add_collector_svm.html

== Agent Machine Configuration

Use the following steps to configure the machine to be used as a Cloud Secure Agent:

.Steps

. Log in to the AWS console and navigate to EC2-Instances page and select _Launch instance_.

. Select a RHEL or CentOS AMI with the appropriate version as mentioned in this page: 
+
 https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/concept_cs_agent_requirements.html

. Select the VPC and Subnet that the Cloud ONTAP instance resides in.

. Select _t2.xlarge_ (4 vcpus and 16 GB RAM) as allocated resources. 

.. Create the EC2 instance.

. Install the required Linux packages using the YUM package manager:  

.. Install _wget_ and _unzip_ native Linux packages.

.. Install selinux (dependency package for the docker-ce):
+
 `wget http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/extras/x86_64/Packages/container-selinux-2.68-1.el7.noarch.rpm`  
+
 `yum install -y container-selinux-2.68-1.el7.noarch.rpm`

. Install the docker-ce (not the native docker) package using https://download.docker.com/linux/centos/7/x86_64/stable/Packages/  (use a version higher than 17.03). 

. SSH to the Redhat EC2 VM
+
 `ssh -i "your_new_pem.pem" <ec2_hostname_or_IP>`
+
 `sudo su -`

. Perform a docker login after installing the required AWS CLI package:
+
 `curl "https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip" -o "awscli-bundle.zip"`
+
 `unzip awscli-bundle.zip`
+ 
 `sudo ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws`
+
 `/usr/local/bin/aws --version`
+
 `aws configure --profile collector_readonly`
+
 `aws ecr get-login --no-include-email --region us-east-1 --profile collector_readonly`
+
 `docker login -u AWS -p <token_generated_above>  <ECR_hostname>`

. Use the following command to verify the steps completed successfully and the cs-ontap-dsc image can be successfully pulled: 
+
 `docker pull 376015418222.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/cs-ontap-dsc:1.25.0` 


== Install the Cloud Secure Agent

. Log in as Administrator or Account Owner to your Cloud Insights environment. 

. Under Cloud Secure, click *Admin > Data Collectors > Agents > +Agent* and specify RHEL as the target platform.

. Copy the Agent Installation command. 

. Paste the Agent Installation command into the RHEL EC2 instance you are logged in to.
+ 
This installs the Cloud Secure agent, providing all of the link:concept_cs_agent_requirements.html[Agent Prerequisites] are met. 

For detailed steps please refer to this link:

 https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/task_cs_add_agent.html#steps-to-install-agent

////
== Add a NetApp ONTAP data collector 

. Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Data Collectors > +Data Collector* and specify the NetApp ONTAP Cloud Volumes data collector. Enter the required information in the fields.

.. Click *Add Collector*

. Verify the Agent Server is running using the 
`docker ps` command and a `docker logs <docker_image_id>` file. 
+
All of the data collector's service status should be in the 'running' state.

// .. Identify an NFS client (in the same VPC subnet as the Agent and Cloud ONTAP) 
 
//.. Install the nfs-utils package in this VPC Subnet: 

//+

//‘yum install -y nfs-utils’  

//.. NFS mount the volume / qtree container that was created in the SVM.
