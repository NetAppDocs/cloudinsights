Cloud Insights gathers metrics from the node on which you install an agent.

== Installation

. From *Admin > Data Collectors*, click *+Data Collector*. Under *Hosts*, choose a platform.
+
. Follow the instructions to configure the agent. The instructions vary depending on the type of Operating System or Platform you are using to collect data. 

== Objects and Counters

The following objects and their counters are collected as Node metrics:

== Setup

Setup and Troubleshooting information can be found on the link:task_config_telegraf_agent.html[Configuring an Agent] page.

== MacOS Memory Usage

Cloud Insights (via Telegraf) and macOS report different numbers for memory usage. Both Telegraf and the Mac activity monitor use metrics gathered from _vm_stat_, however the total memory usage is calculated differently for each. 

*Telegraf* calculates _Memory Used Total_ as follows:

 Memory Used Total = Memory Total - Memory Available Total 

Where _Memory Available Total_ is derived from the sum of "Pages free" and "Pages inactive" in _vm_stat_.

*The Mac activity monitor*, on the other hand, calculates Memory Used as follows: 

 Memory Used = App Memory + Wired Memory + Compressed 

Where:

* _App Memory_ is derived from the difference between “Anonymous pages” and “Pages purgeable” in _vm_stat_,  
* _Wired Memory_ is derived from “Pages wired down” in _vm_stat_, and
* _Compressed_ is derived from “Pages occupied by compressor” in _vm_stat_.
