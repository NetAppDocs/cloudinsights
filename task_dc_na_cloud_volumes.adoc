== Troubleshooting

Some things to try if you encounter problems with this data collector:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]

|Problem:|Try this:
|I received an error similar to this one: 
'Failed to execute request: Connect to <AWS region endpoint>:8080 [<AWS region endpoint>/AWS region endpoint IP>] failed: connect timed out: GET \https://<AWS Region Endpoint FQDN>:8080/v1/Storage/IPRanges HTTP/1.1'
|The link:task_configure_acquisition_unit.html#proxy-configuration-2[proxy] used by Data Infrastructure Insights to communicate with the Acquisition Unit does not communicate between Data Infrastructure Insights and the Data Collector itself. Here are a few things you can try:

Ensure that the acquisition unit is able to resolve the fqdn and reach the required port.
Confirm that a proxy is not required to reach the specified endpoint in the error message.
Curl can be used to test the communication between the acquisition unit and the endpoint. Make sure that you are *not* using a Proxy for this test.

Example:

root@acquisitionunit# curl -s -H accept:application/json -H "Content-type: application/json" -H api-key:<api key used in the data collector credentials -H secret-key:<secret key used in the data collector credentials> -X GET \https://<AWS Regional Endpoint>:8080/v1/Storage/IPRanges
