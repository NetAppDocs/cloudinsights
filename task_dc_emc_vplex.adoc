This data collector acquires inventory and performance data from EMC VPLEX storage systems. For  configuration, the data collector requires an IP address of the VPLEX server and an administrative level domain account.

NOTE: Cloud Insights' performance collection from Vplex clusters requires that the performance archive service be operational, in order to populate the .CSV files and logs that Cloud Insights retrieves via SCP-based file copies. NetApp has observed that many Vplex firmware upgrade/management station updates will leave this functionality non-operational. Customers planning such upgrades may want to proactively ask Dell/EMC if their planned upgrade will leave this functionality inoperable, and if so, how can they re-enable it to minimize gaps in performance visibility? Cloud Insight's Vplex performance code will assess on each poll whether all the expected files exist, and if they are being properly updated; if they are missing or stale, Cloud Insights will log performance collection failures.


== Terminology

Cloud Insightst acquires the following inventory information from the VPLEX data collector. For each asset type acquired, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]

|Vendor/Model Term | Cloud Insights Term
|Cluster|Storage
|Engine|Storage Node
|Device, System Extent|Backend Storage Pool
|Virtual Volume|Volume
|Front-End Port, Back-End Port|Port
|Distributed Device|Storage Synchronization
|Storage View|Volume Map, Volume Mask

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collector.

== Requirements

* An IP address of the VPLEX Management Console
* Administrative level domain account for the VPLEX server
* Port 443 (HTTPS).  Requires outbound connectivity to TCP port 443 on the VPLEX management station. 
* For performance, read-only username and password for ssh/scp access.
* For performance, port 22 is required.

== Troubleshooting
Some things to try if you encounter problems with this data collector:

=== Inventory

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:
|Error: User authentication failed.
|Make sure your credentials for this device are correct.
|===

=== Performance

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:
|Error: VPLEX performance for version below 5.3 is not supported.
|Upgrade VPLEX to 5.3 or above
|Error: No enough data collected.
|•	Check collection timestamp in log file and modify polling interval accordingly
•	Wait for longer time
|Error: Perpetual Log files not being updated.
|Please contact EMC support to enable updating the perpetual log files
|Error: Performance polling interval is too big.
|Check collection timestamp in log file ${logfile} and modify polling interval accordingly
|Error: Performance Remote IP address of VPLEX Management Console is not configured.
|Edit the data source to set Performance Remote IP address of VPLEX Management Console.
|Error: No performance data reported from director
|•	Check that the system performance monitors are running correctly
•	Please contact EMC support to enable updating the system performance monitor log files
