Cloud Insights displays alerts when link:task_create_monitor.html[monitored thresholds] are exceeded. 

TIP: Cloud Insights Basic Edition supports limited functionality for the Monitors feature. Upgrade to Standard Edition for full access to Monitors.

=== Viewing and Managing Alerts

To view and manage alerts, do the following.

. Navigate to the *Alerts > Show All Alerts* page.
. A list of up to the most recent 1,000 alerts is displayed. You can sort this list on any field by clicking the column header for the field. The list displays the following information. Note that not all of these columns are displayed by default. You can select columns by clicking on the "gear" icon image:gear.png[gear icon]:

** *Alert ID*: System-generated unique alert ID
** *Triggered Time*: The time at which the relevant Monitor triggered the alert
** *Current Severity* (Active alerts): The current severity of the active alert
** *Top Severity* (Resolved alerts); The maximum severity of the alert before it was resolved
** *Monitor*: The monitor configured to trigger the alert
** *Triggered On*: The object on which the monitored threshold was breached
** *Status*: Current alert status, _New_ or _In Process_
** *Active Status*: _Active_ or _Resolved_
** *Condition*: The threshold condition that triggered the alert
** *Metric*: The object's metric on which the monitored threshold was breached

 


You can manage an alert by clicking the menu to the right of the alert and choosing one of the following:

* *In Process* to indicate that the alert is under investigation or otherwise needs to be kept open
* *Dismiss* to remove the alert from the list of active alerts.

You can click on an Alert ID to open the Alert Landing Page.

=== Alert Landing Page

The Alert Landing Page provides additional detail about the alert, including a _Summary_, an _Expert View_ showing graphs related to the object's data, any _Related Assets_, and _Comments_ entered by alert investigators.
