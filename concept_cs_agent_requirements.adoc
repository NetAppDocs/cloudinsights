[.lead]
You must link:task_cs_add_agent.html[install an Agent] in order to acquire information from your data collectors. Before you install the Agent, you should ensure that your environment meets operating system, CPU, memory, and disk space requirements.

NOTE: Storage Workload Security is not available in Cloud Insights Federal Edition.

|Component|Linux Requirement
|Operating system|A computer running a licensed version of one of the following:


* CentOS 8 Stream (64-bit), SELinux 
* OpenSUSE Leap 15.3 through 15.5 (64-bit)
* Oracle Linux 8.6 - 8.8, 9.1 through 9.2 (64-bit)
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.6 through 8.8, 9.1 through 9.2 (64-bit), SELinux 
* Rocky 9.2 (64-bit), SELinux 
* SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3 through 15 SP3 (64-bit)
* Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and 22.04 LTS (64-bit)

This computer should be running no other application-level software. A dedicated server is recommended.

|Commands|'unzip' is required for installation. Additionally, the 'sudo su â€“' command is required for installation, running scripts, and uninstall.

//|Docker | The Docker CE package must be installed on the VM hosting the agent. 
//The agent systems should always have the Docker CE package installed. Users should not install the Docker-client-xx or Docker-common-xx native RHEL Docker packages since these do not support the 'docker run' CLI format that Workload Security supports. 
//|Java |OpenJDK Java is required. 
|CPU	|4 CPU cores 
|Memory	|16 GB RAM 
|Available disk space	|Disk space should be allocated in this manner:
//50 GB available for the root partition
/opt/netapp 36 GB (minimum 35 GB free space after filesystem creation)

Note: It is recommended to allocate a little extra disk space to allow for the creation of the filesystem. Ensure that there is at least 35 GB free space in the filesystem.


If /opt is a mounted folder from a NAS storage, make sure that local users have access to this folder. Agent or Data collector may fail to install if local users do not have permission to this folder. see the link:task_cs_add_agent.html#troubleshooting-agent-errors[troubleshooting] section for more details. 

|Network|100 Mbps to 1 Gbps Ethernet connection, static IP address, IP connectivity to all devices, and a required port to the Workload Security instance (80 or 443).

|===

Please note: The Workload Security agent can be installed in the same machine as a Cloud Insights acquisition unit and/or agent. However, it is a best practice to install these in separate machines. In the event that these are installed on the same machine, please allocate disk space as shown below:

|===
|Available disk space	|50-55 GB
For Linux, disk space should be allocated in this manner:
/opt/netapp 25-30 GB
/var/log/netapp 25 GB


|===

== Additional recommendations
* It is strongly recommended to synchronize the time on both the ONTAP system and the Agent machine using *Network Time Protocol (NTP)* or *Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)*.

== In-network rules

//Note that when adding _link:task_add_collector_svm.html#permissions-when-adding-via-cluster-management-ip[csuser]_, that user requires SSH access to the ONTAP management LIF.


[cols=5*,options="header"]

|Protocol|Port|Source	|Destination |Description
|TCP|389(LDAP)
636 (LDAPs / start-tls) |Workload Security Agent|LDAP Server URL|Connect to LDAP
|TCP|443|Workload Security Agent|Cluster or SVM Management IP Address (depending on SVM collector configuration)|API communication with ONTAP
|TCP|35000 - 55000|SVM data LIF IP Addresses|Workload Security Agent|Communication from ONTAP to the Workload Security Agent for Fpolicy events.  These ports must be opened towards the Workload Security Agent in order for ONTAP to send events to it, including any firewall on the Workload Security Agent itself (if present).

NOTE that you do not need to reserve *all* of these ports, but the ports you reserve for this must be within this range. It is recommended to start by reserving ~100 ports, and increasing if necessary.

|TCP|7|Workload Security Agent|SVM data LIF IP Addresses|Echo from Agent to SVM Data LIFs
|SSH |22|Workload Security Agent| Cluster management |Needed for CIFS/SMB user blocking.
