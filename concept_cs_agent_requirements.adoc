[.lead]
You must link:task_cs_add_agent.html[install an Agent] in order to acquire information from your data collectors. Before you install the Agent, you should ensure that your environment meets operating system, CPU, memory, and disk space requirements.

NOTE: Storage Workload Security is not available in Cloud Insights Federal Edition.

|Component|Linux Requirement
|Operating system|A computer running a licensed version of one of the following:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x, 8.x 64-bit, SELinux 
CentOS 7.x 64-bit, SELinux 
CentOS 8 Stream, SELinux 
Ubuntu 20 through 22 64-bit
Rocky 8.x 64-bit, Rocky 9.x 64-bit, SELinux 
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP3, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP4, SELinux on SUSE 15 SP3

This computer should be running no other application-level software. A dedicated server is recommended.

|Commands|'unzip' is required for installation. Additionally, the 'sudo su â€“' command is required for installation, running scripts, and uninstall.

//|Docker | The Docker CE package must be installed on the VM hosting the agent. 
//The agent systems should always have the Docker CE package installed. Users should not install the Docker-client-xx or Docker-common-xx native RHEL Docker packages since these do not support the 'docker run' CLI format that Workload Security supports. 
//|Java |OpenJDK Java is required. 
|CPU	|4 CPU cores 
|Memory	|16 GB RAM 
|Available disk space	|Disk space should be allocated in this manner:
//50 GB available for the root partition
/opt/netapp 35 GB (minimum)

If /opt is a mounted folder from a NAS storage, make sure that local users have access to this folder. Agent or Data collector may fail to install if local users do not have permission to this folder. see the link:task_cs_add_agent.html#troubleshooting-agent-errors[troubleshooting] section for more details. 

|Network|100 Mbps to 1 Gbps Ethernet connection, static IP address, IP connectivity to all devices, and a required port to the Workload Security instance (80 or 443).

|===

Please note: The Workload Security agent can be installed in the same machine as a Cloud Insights acquisition unit and/or agent. However, it is a best practice to install these in separate machines. In the event that these are installed on the same machine, please allocate disk space as shown below:

|===
|Available disk space	|50-55 GB
For Linux, disk space should be allocated in this manner:
/opt/netapp 25-30 GB
/var/log/netapp 25 GB
|===

== Additional recommendations
* It is strongly recommended to synchronize the time on both the ONTAP system and the Agent machine using *Network Time Protocol (NTP)* or *Simple Network Time Protocol (SNTP)*.

== In-network rules

Note that when adding _link:task_add_collector_svm.html#permissions-when-adding-via-cluster-management-ip[csuser]_, that user requires SSH access to the ONTAP management LIF.
