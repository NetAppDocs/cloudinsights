|Component|Linux Requirement
|Operating system|A computer running a licensed version of one of the following:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 64-bit
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.2 64-bit KVM
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 64-bit
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.5 64-bit KVM
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.8 64-bit
Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.8 64-bit KVM
CentOS 7.2 64-bit
CentOS 7.2 64-bit KVM
CentOS 7.5 64-bit
CentOS 7.5 64-bit KVM
CentOS 7.8 64-bit
CentOS 7.8 64-bit KVM

This computer should be running no other application-level software. A dedicated server is recommended.
|Commands|The 'sudo su â€“' command is required for installation, running scripts, and uninstall.

//|Docker | The Docker CE package must be installed on the VM hosting the agent. 
//The agent systems should always have the Docker CE package installed. Users should not install the Docker-client-xx or Docker-common-xx native RHEL Docker packages since these do not support the 'docker run' CLI format that Cloud Secure supports. 
//|Java |OpenJDK Java is required. 
|CPU	|2 CPU cores 
|Memory	|16 GB RAM 
|Available disk space	|Disk space should be allocated in this manner:
//50 GB available for the root partition
/opt/netapp 25 GB
|Network|100 Mbps to 1 Gbps Ethernet connection, static IP address, IP connectivity to all devices, and a required port to the Cloud Secure instance (80 or 443).

|===

Please note: Cloud Insights agent and Cloud Secure agent can be installed in the same machine. However, it is a best practice to install them in separate machines. In the event that both agents are installed on the same machine, please allocate disk space as shown below:
+

|Available disk space	|50 GB
For Linux, disk space should be allocated in this manner:
/opt/netapp 25 GB
/var/log/netapp 25 GB
