Data Infrastructure Insights uses this data collector to gather metrics from Apache Zookeeper.

== Installation

. From *Admin > Data Collectors*, click *+Data Collector*. Choose Apache Zookeeper.
+
Select the Operating System or Platform on which the Telegraf agent is installed. 

. If you haven't already installed an Agent for collection, or you wish to install an Agent for a different Operating System or Platform, click _Show Instructions_ to expand the link:task_config_telegraf_agent.html[Agent installation] instructions.

. Select the Agent Access Key for use with this data collector. You can add a new Agent Access Key by clicking the *+ Agent Access Key* button. Best practice: Use a different Agent Access Key only when you want to group data collectors, for example, by OS/Platform.

. Follow the configuration steps to configure the data collector. The instructions vary depending on the type of Operating System or Platform you are using to collect data.

== Setup

At a minimum, you need to allow the Zookeeper four letter server commands _mntr_, _srvr_, and _stat_.
You can enable these commands using the following format: _4lw.commands.whitelist=mntr, srvr, stat_ in the _zoo.cfg_ file.
There may be other four letter commands that are required in your configuration. See the link:https://zookeeper.apache.org/[Zookeeper] documentation for more information.
