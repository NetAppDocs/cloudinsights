The IBM SAN Volume Controller (SVC) data collector collects inventory and performance data using SSH, supporting a variety of devices that run the SVC operating system.

The list of supported devices includes models such as the SVC, the v7000, the v5000, and the v3700. Refer to the Data Infrastructure Insights support matrix for supported models and firmware versions.

== Terminology

Data Infrastructure Insights acquires the following inventory information from the IBM SVC data collector. For each asset type acquired by Data Infrastructure Insights, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Vendor/Model Term | Data Infrastructure Insights Term
|Drive|Disk
|Cluster|Storage
|Node|Storage Node
|Mdisk Group|Storage Pool
|Vdisk|Volume
|Mdisk|Backend LUNs and paths
|===

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collector. 

=== Inventory Requirements
* IP address of each SVC cluster
* Port 22 available
* Read-only user name and password 

=== Performance Requirements
* SVC Console, which is mandatory for any SVC cluster and required for the SVC discovery foundation package.
* Credentials will require administrative access level only for copying performance files from cluster nodes to the config node. 
* Enable data collection by connecting to the SVC cluster by SSH and running: _svctask startstats -interval 1_
+
Note: Alternatively, enable data collection using the SVC management user interface.

////
* IP address of each SVC cluster
* Port 22 available 
* Public and private key pair that you either generate with Data Infrastructure Insights or reuse a keypair already in use on your SVC
+
If you are reusing an existing keypair, you must convert them from Putty format to OpenSSH format.

* Public key installed on the SVC cluster
* Private key needs to be identified in the Acquisition Unit.
* Access validation: Open ssh session to the SVC cluster using the private key

//Note: No third-party software needs to be installed. 

== Performance Requirements

* SVC Console, which is mandatory for any SVC cluster and required for the SVC discovery foundation package. 
* Administrative access level required only for copying performance files from cluster nodes to the config node.
+
Note: Because this access level is not required for the SVC foundation discovery package, the SVC foundation user might not work successfully. 

//* A private and public SSH key must be generated for this user, and the private key stored so that it is accessible from the Acquisition Unit. If the SVC foundation user has the proper permissions, then the same user and key works. The same SSH key can be used for inventory and performance data. 
* Enable data collection by connecting to the SVC cluster by SSH and running: _svctask startstats -interval 1_
+
Note: Alternatively, enable data collection using the SVC  management user interface.

* Port Requirement: 22
