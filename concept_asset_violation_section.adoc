You can use the Violations section of an asset page to see the violations, if any, that occur in your environment as a result of a performance policy assigned to an asset. Performance policies monitor your network thresholds and enable you to detect a violation of a threshold immediately, identify the implication, and analyze the impact and root cause of the problem in a manner that enables rapid and effective correction.

The following example shows a Violations section that displays on an asset page for a hypervisor:

Using the Violations section
The Violations section enables you to view and manage any of the violations that occur in your network as the result of a performance policy assigned to an asset.

Steps
Log in to the OnCommand Insight web UI.
Locate an asset page by doing either of the following:
On the Insight toolbar, click , type in the name of the asset, and then select the asset from the list.
Click Dashboards, select Assets Dashboard, locate an asset name, and click it.
The asset page displays. The Violations section displays the time the violation occurred and a description of the threshold that was crossed, along with a hyperlink to the asset on which the violation occurred (for example "2 violations fir ds-30 with Latency - Total > 50").
You can perform any of the following optional tasks:
Use the filter box to show only specific violations.
Click a page number to browse through the violations by page if there are more than five violations in the table.
Change the sort order of the columns in a table to either ascending (up arrow) or descending (down arrow) by clicking the arrow in the column header.
Click the asset name in any description to display its asset page; a red circle indicates issues that need further investigation.
You can click the performance policy, which displays the Edit Policy dialog box, to review the performance policy and make changes to the policy if necessary.
