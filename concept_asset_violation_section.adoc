You can use the Violations section of an asset page to see the violations, if any, that occur in your environment as a result of a performance policy assigned to an asset. Performance policies monitor thresholds and enable you to detect a violation of a threshold immediately, identify the implication, and analyze the impact and root cause of the problem in a manner that enables rapid and effective correction.

The following example shows a Violations section that displays on an asset page for a hypervisor:

The Violations section enables you to view and manage any of the violations that occur in your network as the result of a performance policy assigned to an asset.

.Steps
* Locate an asset page by doing any of the following:

** Type the name of the asset in the Search area, and then select the asset from the list.

** In a dashboard widget, click on the name of an asset.

** Query for a set of assets and select on from the results list.

The asset page displays. The Violations section displays the time the violation occurred and a description of the threshold that was crossed, along with a hyperlink to the asset on which the violation occurred (for example "2 violations for ds-30 with Latency - Total > 50").

You can perform any of the following optional tasks:

* Use the filter box to show only specific violations.
* Change the sort order of the columns in a table to either ascending (up arrow) or descending (down arrow) by clicking the arrow in the column header.
* Click the asset name in any description to display its asset page; a red circle indicates issues that need further investigation.
* You can click the performance policy, which displays the Edit Policy dialog box, to review the performance policy and make changes to the policy if necessary.

If you determine the issue is no longer a cause for concern, click the "three dots" menu on the right and select "Dismiss Violation" to remove a violation from the list.
