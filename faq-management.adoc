This FAQ answers common questions about managing Cloud Insights environments.

== Can I give access to Cloud Insights to a specific user, while restricting the view to only certain resources (ie. SVM and related volumes, VMs, servers)?

Cloud Insights provides role-based access. For example, access to Reporting is controlled through Cloud Insights's Data Warehouse reporting. Reports can be scheduled, emailed as PDF, HTML or CSV, or to a file share or even a URL requiring the user to authenticate before viewing. User-based access is granted in the form of Admins, Users and Guests. Active directory/ldap support is also available.
