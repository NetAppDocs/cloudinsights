The All Activity page helps you understand the actions performed on entities in the Cloud Secure environment. 


== Examining All Activity Data  

Click *Forensics > Activity Forensics* and click the *All Activity* tab to access the All Activity page.
This page provides an overview of activities in your environment, highlighting the following information:

* A graph showing _Activity History_ (accessed per minute/per 5 minutes/per 10 minutes based on selected global time range)
+
You can zoom the graph by dragging out a rectangle in the graph. The entire page will be loaded to display the zoomed time range. When zoomed in, a button is displayed that lets the user zoom out. 

* A chart of _Activity Types_ 
* A chart of Activity on _Entity Types_
* A list of the _All Activity_ data

The _All Activity_ table shows the following information:

* The time an entity was accessed including the year, month, day, and time of the last access. 

* The user that accessed the entity with a link to the link:forensic_user_overview.html[User information].

//Above should be new user profile?

* The activity the user performed. Supported types are:  
**	Change Group Ownership
**	Change Owner
**	Change Permission
**	Copy
**	Create
**	Delete
**	Move
**	Read
**	Read Metadata
**	Rename
**	Write
**	Write Metadata
**	Other Change

* The *Path* to the entity with a link to the link:forensic_entity_detail.html[Entity Detail Data]
 
** The entity type, including entity (i.e. file) extension (.doc, .docx, .tmp, etc.)
** The device where the entities reside
** Protocol used to fetch events. 

//* The *Source IP* address from which the activity was performed. 


== Filtering Forensic Activity History Data

There are two methods you can use to filter data.
1)	Hover over the field in the table and click the filter icon that appears. The value is added to the appropriate filters in the top _Filter By_ list.

2)	Filter data by typing in the _Filter By_ field:
+
** Select the appropriate filter from the top ‘Filter By’ widget by clicking the *[+]* button:

** Enter the search text.

** Press Enter or click outside of the filter box.


You can filter Forensic Activity data by the following fields:

* The Activity type: 
** Change Group Ownership
**	Change Owner
**	Change Permission
**	Copy
**	Create
**	Delete
**	Move
**	Read
**	Read Metadata
**	Rename
**	Write
**	Write Metadata
**	Other Change 

* Source IP from which the entity was accessed. You must provide a valid source IP address in double quotes, for example “10.1.1.1.”.  Incomplete IPs such as “10.1.1.*”, “10.1.*.*”, etc. will not work.

* Protocol to fetch activities
* Noise Reduction to filter activities on temporary files which are generated as part of the normal operating process. If noise reduction is enabled, temporary files of extension .tmp, .ldb, .laccdb, .$db etc. are filtered.                 
* Username of the user performing the activity. You need to provide the exact Username to filter. Search with partial username, or partial username prefixed or suffixed with ‘*’ will not work.

The following fields are subject to special filtering rules:

* Entity Type, using entity (file) extension
* Path of the entity 
* User performing the activity
* Device where entities reside
* Volume where entities reside

The preceeding fields are subject to the following when filtering:

* Exact value should be within quotes: Example: "searchtext"
* Wildcard strings must contain no quotes: Example: *searchtext*, searchtext, will filter for any strings containing ‘searchtext’.
* String with a prefix, Example: searchtext* , will search any strings which start with ‘searchtext’.


== Exporting All Activity

You can export the activity history to a .CSV file by clicking the _Export_ button above the Activity History table. Note that only the top 10,000 records are exported.
