The All Activity page helps you understand the actions performed on entities in the Cloud Secure environment. 


== Examining All Activity Data  

Click *Forensics > Activity Forensics* and click the *All Activity* tab to access the All Activity page.
This page provides an overview of activities in your environment, highlighting the following information:

* A graph showing _Activity History_ (accessed per minute/per 5 minutes/per 10 minutes based on selected global time range)
+
You can zoom the graph by dragging out a rectangle in the graph. The entire page will be loaded to display the zoomed time range. When zoomed in, a button is displayed that lets the user zoom out. 

* A chart of _Activity Types_. To obtain activity history data by activity type, click on corresponding x-axis label link.
* A chart of Activity on _Entity Types_. To obtain activity history data by entity type, click on corresponding x-axis label link.
* A list of the _All Activity_ data

The _*All Activity*_ table shows the following information. Note that not all of these columns are displayed by default. You can select columns to display by clicking on the "gear" icon  image:GearIcon.png[gear icon].

* The *time* an entity was accessed including the year, month, day, and time of the last access. 

* The *user* that accessed the entity with a link to the link:forensic_user_overview.html[User information].

//Above should be new user profile?

* The *activity* the user performed. Supported types are:  

**	*Change Group Ownership* - Group Ownership is of file or folder is changed. For more details about group ownership please see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.11/dn789205(v=ws.11)?redirectedfrom=MSDN[this link.]

**	*Change Owner* - Ownership of file or folder is changed to another user.

**	*Change Permission* - File or folder permission is changed.

**	*Create* - Create file or folder.

**	*Delete* - Delete file or folder. If a folder is deleted, _delete_ events are obtained for all the files in that folder and subfolders. 

**	*Read* - File is read.

**	*Read Metadata* - Only on enabling folder monitoring option. Will be generated on opening a folder on Windows or Running “ls” inside a folder in Linux.

**	*Rename* - Rename file or folder.

**	*Write* - Data is written to a file.

**	*Write Metadata* - File metadata is written, for example, permission changed.

**	*Other Change* - Any other event which are not described above. All unmapped events are mapped to “Other Change” activity type. Applicable to files and folders.

* The *Path* to the entity with a link to the link:forensic_entity_detail.html[Entity Detail Data]
 
* The *Entity Type*, including entity (i.e. file) extension (.doc, .docx, .tmp, etc.)

* The *Device* where the entities reside

* The *Protocol* used to fetch events. 

* The *Original Path* used for rename events when the original file was renamed. This column is not visible in the table by default. Use the column selector to add this column to the table.

* The *Volume* where the entities reside. This column is not visible in the table by default. Use the column selector to add this column to the table.


//* The *Source IP* address from which the activity was performed. 


== Filtering Forensic Activity History Data

There are two methods you can use to filter data.

.	Hover over the field in the table and click the filter icon that appears. The value is added to the appropriate filters in the top _Filter By_ list.

.	Filter data by typing in the _Filter By_ field:
+
Select the appropriate filter from the top ‘Filter By’ widget by clicking the *[+]* button:
+
image:Forensic_Activity_Filter.png[Entity Filer, width=500]
+
Enter the search text
+
Press Enter or click outside of the filter box to apply the filter.


You can filter Forensic Activity data by the following fields:

* The *Activity* type.

////
** Change Group Ownership
**	Change Owner
**	Change Permission
**	Copy
**	Create
**	Delete
**	Move
**	Read
**	Read Metadata
**	Rename
**	Write
**	Write Metadata
**	Other Change 
////

* *Source IP* from which the entity was accessed. You must provide a valid source IP address in double quotes, for example “10.1.1.1.”.  Incomplete IPs such as “10.1.1.*”, “10.1.*.*”, etc. will not work.

* *Protocol* to fetch protocol-specific activities.

//* *Noise Reduction* to filter activities on temporary files which are generated as part of the normal operating process. If noise reduction is enabled, temporary files of extension .tmp, .ldb, .laccdb, .$db etc. are filtered.

* *Username* of the user performing the activity. You need to provide the exact Username to filter. Search with partial username, or partial username prefixed or suffixed with ‘*’ will not work.

* *Noise Reduction* to filter out newly-created files created by the user (i.e. in the last 2 hours). It is also used to filter temporary files (for example, .tmp files) accessed by the user. 


The following fields are subject to special filtering rules:

* *Entity Type*, using entity (file) extension
* *Path* of the entity 
* *User* performing the activity
* *Device* (SVM) where entities reside
* *Volume* where entities reside
* The *Original Path* used for rename events when the original file was renamed. 

The preceding fields are subject to the following when filtering:

* Exact value should be within quotes: Example: "searchtext"
* Wildcard strings must contain no quotes: Example: searchtext, \*searchtext*, will filter for any strings containing ‘searchtext’.
* String with a prefix, Example: searchtext* , will search any strings which start with ‘searchtext’.

== Sorting Forensic Activity History Data

You can sort activity history data by _Time, User,  Source IP, Activity, Path_ and _Entity Type_. By default, the table is sorted by descending _Time_ order, meaning the latest data will be displayed first. Sorting is disabled for _Device_ and _Protocol_ fields.


== Exporting All Activity

You can export the activity history to a .CSV file by clicking the _Export_ button above the Activity History table. Note that only the top 10,000 records are exported.

== Column Selection for All Activity 

The _All activity_ table shows select columns by default. To add, remove, or change the columns, click the gear icon on the right of the table and select from the list of available columns.

== Activity History Retention

Activity history is retained for 13 months for active Cloud Secure environments.

== Troubleshooting

|===
|Problem|Try This
|In the “All Activities” table, under the ‘User’ column, the user name is shown as:
“ldap:HQ.COMPANYNAME.COM:S-1-5-21-3577637-1906459482-1437260136-1831817”
or
"ldap:default:80038003”

|Possible reasons could be:
1. No User Directory Collectors have been configured yet. To add one, go to *Admin > Data Collectors > User Directory Collectors* and click on *+User Directory Collector*. Choose _Active Directory_ or _LDAP Directory Server_.
2. A User Directory Collector has been configured, however it has stopped or is in error state. Please go to *Admin > Data Collectors > User Directory Collectors* and check the status. Refer to the link:http://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/task_config_user_dir_connect.html#troubleshooting-user-directory-collector-configuration-errors[User Directory Collector troubleshooting] section of the documentation for troubleshooting tips.
After configuring properly, the name will get automatically resolved within 24 hours.
If it still does not get resolved, check if you have added the correct User Data Collector. Make sure that the user is indeed part of the added Active Directory/LDAP Directory Server.

|Some NFS events are not seen in UI.
|Check the following:
1.	A user directory collector for AD server with POSIX attributes set should be running with the unixid attribute enabled from UI.
2.	Any user doing NFS access should be seen when searched in the user page from UI
3.	Raw events (Events for whom the user is not yet discovered) are not supported for NFS
4.	Anonymous access to the NFS export will not be monitored.
5.	Make sure NFS version used in lesser than NFS4.1.
