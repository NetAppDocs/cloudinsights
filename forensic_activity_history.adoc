The All Activity page helps you understand the actions performed on entities in the Cloud Secure environment. 


== Examining All Activity Data  

Click *Forensics > Activity Forensics* and click the *All Activity* tab to access the All Activity page.
This page provides an overview of activities in your environment, highlighting the following information:

* A graph showing _Activity History_ (accessed per minute/per 5 minutes/per 10 minutes based on selected global time range)
+
You can zoom the graph by dragging out a rectangle in the graph. The entire page will be loaded to display the zoomed time range. When zoomed in, a button is displayed that lets the user zoom out. 

* A chart of _Activity Types_. To obtain activity history data by activity type, click on corresponding x-axis label link.
* A chart of Activity on _Entity Types_. To obtain activity history data by entity type, click on corresponding x-axis label link.
* A list of the _All Activity_ data

The _*All Activity*_ table shows the following information:

* The *time* an entity was accessed including the year, month, day, and time of the last access. 

* The *user* that accessed the entity with a link to the link:forensic_user_overview.html[User information].

//Above should be new user profile?

* The *activity* the user performed. Supported types are:  

**	*Change Group Ownership* - Group Ownership is of file is changed. For more details about group ownership please see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.11/dn789205(v=ws.11)?redirectedfrom=MSDN[this link.]

**	*Change Owner* - Ownership of File is changed to another user.

**	*Change Permission* - File permission is changed.

**	*Create* - Create file or directory.

**	*Delete* - Delete file or directory. If a directory is deleted, _delete_ events are obtained for all the files in that directory and subdirectories. 

**	*Read* - File is read.

**	*Read Metadata* - File attributes are read, for example, name of the file, size of the file, file permissions.

**	*Rename* - Rename file or directory.

**	*Write* - Data is written to a file.

**	*Write Metadata* - File metadata is written, for example, permission changed.

**	*Other Change* - Any other event which are not described above. All unmapped events are mapped to “Other Change” activity type.

* The *Path* to the entity with a link to the link:forensic_entity_detail.html[Entity Detail Data]
 
* The *Entity Type*, including entity (i.e. file) extension (.doc, .docx, .tmp, etc.)

* The *Device* where the entities reside

* The *Protocol* used to fetch events. 

//* The *Source IP* address from which the activity was performed. 


== Filtering Forensic Activity History Data

There are two methods you can use to filter data.

.	Hover over the field in the table and click the filter icon that appears. The value is added to the appropriate filters in the top _Filter By_ list.

.	Filter data by typing in the _Filter By_ field:
+
Select the appropriate filter from the top ‘Filter By’ widget by clicking the *[+]* button:
+
image:Forensic_Activity_Filter.png[Entity Filer, width=500]
+
Enter the search text
+
Press Enter or click outside of the filter box to apply the filter.


You can filter Forensic Activity data by the following fields:

* The *Activity* type.

////
** Change Group Ownership
**	Change Owner
**	Change Permission
**	Copy
**	Create
**	Delete
**	Move
**	Read
**	Read Metadata
**	Rename
**	Write
**	Write Metadata
**	Other Change 
////

* *Source IP* from which the entity was accessed. You must provide a valid source IP address in double quotes, for example “10.1.1.1.”.  Incomplete IPs such as “10.1.1.*”, “10.1.*.*”, etc. will not work.

* *Protocol* to fetch protocol-specific activities.

* *Noise Reduction* to filter activities on temporary files which are generated as part of the normal operating process. If noise reduction is enabled, temporary files of extension .tmp, .ldb, .laccdb, .$db etc. are filtered.

* *Username* of the user performing the activity. You need to provide the exact Username to filter. Search with partial username, or partial username prefixed or suffixed with ‘*’ will not work.

The following fields are subject to special filtering rules:

* *Entity Type*, using entity (file) extension
* *Path* of the entity 
* *User* performing the activity
* *Device* (SVM) where entities reside
* *Volume* where entities reside

The preceding fields are subject to the following when filtering:

* Exact value should be within quotes: Example: "searchtext"
* Wildcard strings must contain no quotes: Example: searchtext, *searchtext*, will filter for any strings containing ‘searchtext’.
* String with a prefix, Example: searchtext* , will search any strings which start with ‘searchtext’.

== Sorting Forensic Activity History Data

You can sort activity history data by _Time, User,  Source IP, Activity, Path_ and _Entity Type_. By default, the table is sorted by descending _Time_ order, meaning the latest data will be displayed first. Sorting is disabled for _Device_ and _Protocol_ fields.


== Exporting All Activity

You can export the activity history to a .CSV file by clicking the _Export_ button above the Activity History table. Note that only the top 10,000 records are exported.

== Activity History Retention

Activity history is retained for 13 months for active Cloud Secure environments.
