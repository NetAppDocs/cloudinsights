The All Activity page helps you understand the actions performed on entities in the Workload Security environment. 


== Examining All Activity Data  

Click *Forensics > Activity Forensics* and click the *All Activity* tab to access the All Activity page.
This page provides an overview of activities on your tenant, highlighting the following information:

* A graph showing _Activity History_ (based on selected global time range)
+
You can zoom the graph by dragging out a rectangle in the graph. The entire page will be loaded to display the zoomed time range. When zoomed in, a button is displayed that lets the user zoom out. 

* A list of the _All Activity_ data.
* A group by dropdown will provide the option to group the activity by users, path, entity type etc.
* A common path button will be available above the table on click of which we can get slide out panel with entity path details.


The _*All Activity*_ table shows the following information. Note that not all of these columns are displayed by default. You can select columns to display by clicking on the "gear" icon.

* The *time* an entity was accessed including the year, month, day, and time of the last access. 

* The *user* that accessed the entity with a link to the link:forensic_user_overview.html[User information] as a slide-out panel.

//Above should be new user profile?

* The *activity* the user performed. Supported types are:  

**	*Change Group Ownership* - Group Ownership is of file or folder is changed. For more details about group ownership please see link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/orphan-topics/ws.11/dn789205(v=ws.11)?redirectedfrom=MSDN[this link.]

**	*Change Owner* - Ownership of file or folder is changed to another user.

**	*Change Permission* - File or folder permission is changed.

**	*Create* - Create file or folder.

**	*Delete* - Delete file or folder. If a folder is deleted, _delete_ events are obtained for all the files in that folder and subfolders. 

**	*Read* - File is read.

**	*Read Metadata* - Only on enabling folder monitoring option. Will be generated on opening a folder on Windows or Running “ls” inside a folder in Linux.

**	*Rename* - Rename file or folder.

**	*Write* - Data is written to a file.

**	*Write Metadata* - File metadata is written, for example, permission changed.

**	*Other Change* - Any other event which are not described above. All unmapped events are mapped to “Other Change” activity type. Applicable to files and folders.

* The *Path* is _entity_ path.

* The *1st Level Folder (Root)* is the root directory of entity path in lower case.
* The *2nd Level Folder* is the second level directory of entity path in lower case.
* The *3rd Level Folder* is the third level directory of entity path in lower case.
* The *4th Level Folder* is the forth level directory of entity path in lower case.

* The *Entity Type*, including entity (i.e. file) extension (.doc, .docx, .tmp, etc.).

* The *Device* where the entities reside.

* The *Protocol* used to fetch events.

* The *Original Path* used for rename events when the original file was renamed. This column is not visible in the table by default. Use the column selector to add this column to the table.

* The *Volume* where the entities reside. This column is not visible in the table by default. Use the column selector to add this column to the table.

Selecting a table row opens a slide-out panel with the user profile in one tab, and the activity and entity overview in another tab.

image:ws_forensics_slideout.png[forensics page showing slideout displaying user activity]

The default _Group by_ method is _Activity forensics_.  If you select a different _Group By_ method--for example, Entity Type--the entity _Group By_ table will be displayed. If no selection is made then _Group By_ *all* is displayed. 

* Activity count is displayed as a hyperlink; selecting this will add the selected grouping as a filter. The table of activity will update based on that filter.

* Note that if you change the filter, alter the time range, or refresh the screen, you will not be able to return to the filtered results without setting the filter again.

//* There will be a return to result option in table header of all activities after doing step 1. On click of which user can move back to group by table. If we change any filters, time range or do refresh we will lose the option to return.



== Filtering Forensic Activity History Data

There are two methods you can use to filter data.

* The Filter can be added from the slide-out panel. The value is added to the appropriate filters in the top _Filter By_ list.

* Filter data by typing in the _Filter By_ field:
+
Select the appropriate filter from the top ‘Filter By’ widget by clicking the *[+]* button:
+
image:Forensic_Activity_Filter.png[Entity Filer, width=500]
+
Enter the search text
+
Press Enter or click outside of the filter box to apply the filter.


You can filter Forensic Activity data by the following fields:

* The *Activity* type.


* *Source IP* from which the entity was accessed. You must provide a valid source IP address in double quotes, for example “10.1.1.1.”.  Incomplete IPs such as “10.1.1.*”, “10.1.*.*”, etc. will not work.

* *Protocol* to fetch protocol-specific activities.


* *Username* of the user performing the activity. You need to provide the exact Username to filter. Search with partial username, or partial username prefixed or suffixed with ‘*’ will not work.

* *Noise Reduction* to filter files which are created in the last 2 hours by the user. It is also used to filter temporary files (for example, .tmp files) accessed by the user.

* *Domain* of the user performing the activity. You need to provide the *exact domain* to filter. Searching for partial domain, or partial domain prefixed or suffixed with wildcard ('*'), will not work. _None_ can be specified to search for missing domain.


The following fields are subject to special filtering rules:

* *Entity Type*, using entity (file) extension - it is preferable to specify exact entity type within quotes. For example _“txt”_.
* *Path* of the entity - Directory Path filters (path string ending with /) up to 4 directories deep are recommended for faster results. For example, _"/home/userX/nested1/nested2/"_. See the table below for more details.

* 1st Level Folder (Root) - root directory of entity Path as filters.
For example, if entity path is /home/userX/nested1/nested2/, then home OR "home” can be used.

* 2nd Level Folder - 2nd level directory of entity Path filters.
For example, if entity path is /home/userX/nested1/nested2/, then userX OR "userX” can be used.

* 3rd Level Folder – 3rd level directory of entity Path filters.
* For example, if entity path is /home/userX/nested1/nested2/, then nested1 OR “nested1” can be used.

* 4th Level Folder - Directory 4th level directory of entity Path filters.
For example, if entity path is /home/userX/nested1/nested2/, then nested2 OR “nested2” can be used.


* *User* performing the activity - it is preferable to specify the exact user within quotes. For example, _"Administrator"_.

* *Device* (SVM) where entities reside
* *Volume* where entities reside
* The *Original Path* used for rename events when the original file was renamed. 

The preceding fields are subject to the following when filtering:

* Exact value should be within quotes: Example: "searchtext"
* Wildcard strings must contain no quotes: Example: searchtext, \*searchtext*, will filter for any strings containing ‘searchtext’.
* String with a prefix, Example: searchtext* , will search any strings which start with ‘searchtext’.

== Activity Forensics Filter Examples:

|===
|User applied Filter expression|Expected Outcome|Performance assessment|Comment

|Path = "/home/userX/nested1/nested2/"|Recursive lookup of all files and folders under given directory |Fast|Directory searches up to 4 directories will be fast. 
|Path = "/home/userX/nested1/"|Recursive lookup of all files and folders under given directory |Fast|Directory searches up to 4 directories will be fast. 
|Path = “/home/userX/nested1/test”|Recursive lookup of all files and folders under given path regex(test* could mean file OR directory OR Both)|Slower|Directory+File regex search will be slower to search on compared to Directory searches.
|Path = "/home/userX/nested1/nested2/nested3/"|Recursive lookup of all files and folders under given directory |Slower|More than 4 directories searches are slower to search on.
|Any other Non path based filters. User and Entity Type filters recommended to be in quotes
e.g., User="Administrator"
Entity Type="txt"||Fast|

|===

NOTE:

. The Activity count displayed alongside the All Activity icon is rounded off to 30 mins when the selected time range spans more than 3 days. e.g., a time range of _Sept 1st 10:15 am to Sept 7th 10:15 am_ will show Activity counts from Sept 1st 10:00 am to Sept 7th 10:30 am.
. Likewise the count metrics shown in Activity History graph are rounded off to 30 mins when the selected time range spans more than 3 days.


== Sorting Forensic Activity History Data

You can sort activity history data by _Time, User,  Source IP, Activity,_,  _Entity Type_, 1st Level Folder (Root), 2nd Level Folder, 3rd Level Folder and 4th Level Folder. By default, the table is sorted by descending _Time_ order, meaning the latest data will be displayed first. Sorting is disabled for _Device_ and _Protocol_ fields.


== User Guide for Asynchronous Exports

=== Overview


The Asynchronous Exports feature in Storage Workload Security is designed to handle large data exports. 

=== Step-by-Step Guide: Exporting Data with Asynchronous Exports


. *Initiate Export*: Select the desired time duration and filters for the export and click on the export button.
. *Wait for Export to Complete*: The processing time can range from a few minutes to a few hours. You may need to refresh the forensics page a few times. Once the export job is complete, the "Download last export CSV file" button will be enabled.
. *Download*: Click on the "Download last created export file" button to get the exported data in a .zip format. This data will be available for download until the user initiates another Asynchronous Export or 3 days have elapsed, whichever occurs first. The button will remain enabled until another Asynchronous Export is initiated.
. *Limitations*:
** The number of asynchronous downloads is currently limited to 1 per user and 3 per tenant.
** The exported data is limited to a maximum of 1 million records.



A sample script to extract forensic data via API is present at _/opt/netapp/cloudsecure/agent/export-script/_ on the agent. See the readme at this location for more details about the script.


== Column Selection for All Activity 

The _All activity_ table shows select columns by default. To add, remove, or change the columns, click the gear icon on the right of the table and select from the list of available columns.

== Activity History Retention

Activity history is retained for 13 months for active Workload Security environments.





== Applicability of Filters in Forensics Page

|===
|Filter|What it does|Example|Applicable for these Filters|Not applicable for these filters|Result

|* (Asterisk)|enables you to search for everything|Auto*03172022

If search text contains hyphen or underscore, give expression in brackets. e.g., (svm*) for searching svm-123|User, Entity Type, Device, Volume, Original Path, 1stLevel Folder, 2ndLevel Folder, 3rdLevel Folder, 4thLevel Folder||Returns all resources that start with “Auto" and end with “03172022”
|? (question mark)|enables you to search for a specific number of characters|AutoSabotageUser1_03172022?|User, Entity Type, Device, Volume, 1stLevel Folder, 2ndLevel Folder, 3rdLevel Folder, 4thLevel Folder||returns AutoSabotageUser1_03172022A, AutoSabotageUser1_03172022B, AutoSabotageUser1_031720225, and so on
|OR|enables you to specify multiple entities|AutoSabotageUser1_03172022 OR AutoRansomUser4_03162022|User, Domain, Entity Type, Original Path||returns any of AutoSabotageUser1_03172022 OR AutoRansomUser4_03162022
|NOT|allows you to exclude text from the search results|NOT AutoRansomUser4_03162022|User,Domain, Entity Type, Original Path, 1stLevel Folder, 2ndLevel Folder, 3rdLevel Folder, 4thLevel Folder|Device|returns everything that does not start with"AutoRansomUser4_03162022”
|None|searches for NULL values in all fields|None|Domain||returns results where the target field is empty

|===


== Path / Original path Search

Search results with and  without / will be different 

|===

|"/AutoDir1/AutoFile03242022"	|Only Exact search works; returns all activities with exact path as /AutoDir1/AutoFile03242022 (case insensitively)
|"/AutoDir1/ "	|Works; returns all activities with 1st level directory matching with AutoDir1 (case insensitively)
|"/AutoDir1/AutoFile03242022/"	|Works; returns all activities with 1st level directory matching with AutoDir1 and 2nd level directory matching with AutoFile03242022 (case insensitively)
|/AutoDir1/AutoFile03242022 OR /AutoDir1/AutoFile03242022	|Doesn’t work
|NOT /AutoDir1/AutoFile03242022	|Doesn’t work
|NOT /AutoDir1	|Doesn’t work
|NOT /AutoFile03242022	|Doesn’t work
|*	|Doesn’t work

== Local root SVM  user activity changes 
 

If a local root SVM user is performing any activity, the IP of the client on which the NFS share is mounted is now considered in the username, which will be shown as root@<ip-address-of-the-client> in both forensic activity and user activity pages.
 
For example: 

* If SVM-1 is monitored by Workload Security, and the root user of that SVM mounts the share on a client with IP address 10.197.12.40, the username shown in forensic activity page will be _root@10.197.12.40_.
 
* If the same SVM-1 is mounted into another client with IP address 10.197.12.41, the username shown in forensic activity page will be _root@10.197.12.41_.
 
*•	This is done to segregate NFS root user activity by IP address. Previously, all the activity was considered to be done by _root_ user only, with no IP distinction.





== Troubleshooting

|===
|Problem|Try This
|In the “All Activities” table, under the ‘User’ column, the user name is shown as:
“ldap:HQ.COMPANYNAME.COM:S-1-5-21-3577637-1906459482-1437260136-1831817”
or
"ldap:default:80038003”

|Possible reasons could be:
1. No User Directory Collectors have been configured yet. To add one, go to *Workload Security > Collectors > User Directory Collectors* and click on *+User Directory Collector*. Choose _Active Directory_ or _LDAP Directory Server_.
2. A User Directory Collector has been configured, however it has stopped or is in error state. Please go to *Collectors > User Directory Collectors* and check the status. Refer to the link:http://docs.netapp.com/us-en/cloudinsights/task_config_user_dir_connect.html#troubleshooting-user-directory-collector-configuration-errors[User Directory Collector troubleshooting] section of the documentation for troubleshooting tips.
After configuring properly, the name will get automatically resolved within 24 hours.
If it still does not get resolved, check if you have added the correct User Data Collector. Make sure that the user is indeed part of the added Active Directory/LDAP Directory Server.

|Some NFS events are not seen in UI.
|Check the following:
1.	A user directory collector for AD server with POSIX attributes set should be running with the unixid attribute enabled from UI.
2.	Any user doing NFS access should be seen when searched in the user page from UI
3.	Raw events (Events for whom the user is not yet discovered) are not supported for NFS
4.	Anonymous access to the NFS export will not be monitored.
5.	Make sure NFS version used in lesser than NFS4.1.


|After typing some letters containing a wildcard character like asterisk (*) in the filters on the Forensics _All Activity_ or  _Entities_ pages, the pages load very slowly.
|An asterisk (\*) in the search string searches for everything. However, leading wildcard strings like  _*<searchTerm>_ or _*<searchTerm>*_ will result in a slow query.
To get better performance, use prefix strings instead, in the format _<searchTerm>*_ (in other words, append the asterisk (*) _after_ a search term).
Example: use the string _testvolume*_, rather than _*testvolume_ or _*test*volume_.

Use a directory search to see all activities underneath a given folder recursively (Hierarchical search). e.g., “/path1/path2/path3/” will list all the activities recursively under /path1/path2/path3.
Alternatively use the "Add To Filter" option under the All Activity tab.”



|I am encountering a "Request failed with status code 500/503" error when using a Path filter.
|Try using a smaller date range for filtering records.

|Forensic UI is loading data slowly when using the _path_ filter.
|Directory Path filters (path string ending with /) up to 4 directories deep are recommended for faster results. e.g., If the directory path is /Aaa/Bbb/Ccc/Ddd, try searching for “/Aaa/Bbb/Ccc/Ddd/”  to load data faster.
