You can use the Related Alerts section of an asset page to see any alerts that occur on your tenant as a result of a monitor assigned to an asset. Monitors generate alerts based on conditions you set, and enable you to identify the implication and analyze the impact and root cause of the problem in a manner that enables rapid and effective correction.

The following example shows a typical Related Alerts section that displays on an asset page:

The asset page displays. The Related Alerts section displays the time the alert was triggered as well as current status of the alert and the monitor that triggered it. You can click the Alert ID to open the landing page for the alert for further investigation.
