The Cloud Insights Log Explorer is a powerful tool for querying system logs. In addition to helping with investigations, you can also save a log query in a Monitor to provide alerts when those particular log triggers are activated.

To begin exploring logs, click *Queries > +New Log Query*.

Select an available log from the list. 
//This list may vary based on your current Cloud Insights environment configuration.

NOTE: The types of logs available for querying may vary based on your environment. Additional log types may be added over time.

You can set filters to further refine the results of the query. For example, to find all log messages showing a failure, set a filter for _Messages_ containing the word "failed".   

TIP: You can begin typing the desired text in the filter field; Cloud Insights will prompt you to create a wildcard search containing the string as you type.

The results are displayed in a graph showing the number of log instances in each time period shown. Below the graph are the log entries temselves. The graph and the entries refresh automatically based on the selected time range.

== Filtering

=== Include / Exclude
When filtering the logs, you can choose to *include* or *exclude* the strings you type. These are displayed in the completed filter as "NOT <value".

=== Advanced Filtering

When you are filtering for text or list values in queries or dashboard widgets, as you begin typing you are presented with the option to create a *wildcard filter* based on the current text. Selecting this option will return all results that match the wildcard expression. You can also create expressions using NOT, AND, or OR, or you can select the "None" option to filter for null values.

Filters based on wildcards or expressions (e.g. NOT, OR, "None", etc.) display in dark blue in the filter field. Items that you select directly from the list are displayed in light blue.

//Note that Wildcard and Expression filtering works with text or lists but not with numerics, dates or booleans.



==== Refining Filters

You can use the following to refine your filter:

|===
|Filter|What it does | Example | Result
| * (Asterisk) |enables you to search for everything | vol*rhel |returns all resources that start with "vol" and end with "rhel"
| ? (question mark) |enables you to search for a specific number of characters|  BOS-PRD??-S12 |returns BOS-PRD**__12__**-S12, BOS-PRD**__23__**-S12, and so on
| OR |enables you to specify multiple entities | FAS2240 OR CX600 OR FAS3270 |returns any of FAS2440, CX600, or FAS3270
| NOT |allows you to exclude text from the search results |  NOT EMC* |returns everything that does not start with "EMC"
| _None_ |searches for NULL values in all fields | _None_ |returns results where the target field is empty
| Not * |searches for NULL values in _text-only_ fields | Not * |returns results where the target field is empty
|===

If you enclose a filter string in double quotes, Insight treats everything between the first and last quote as an exact match. Any special characters or operators inside the quotes will be treated as literals. For example, filtering for "*" will return results that are a literal asterisk; the asterisk will not be treated as a wildcard in this case. The operators OR and NOT will also be treated as literal strings when enclosed in double quotes.



//=== Graph Grouping





== The Log Graph

The graph shows the number of log entries, grouped into _buckets_, which are based on the selected dashboard time range. The buckets for each time range are as follows:

|===
|Dashboard Time Range|Bucket size
|Last 15 Minutes|10 Seconds
|Last 30 Minutes|15 Seconds
|Last 60 Minutes|30 Seconds
|Last 2 Hours|1 Minute
|Last 3 Hours|5 Minutes
|Last 6 Hours|5 Minutes
|Last 12 Hours|10 Minutes
|Last 24 Hours|15 Minutes
|Last 2 Days|30 Minutes
|Last 3 Days|45 Minutes
|Last 7 Days|2 Hours
|Last 30 Days|1 Day
|===

To zoom in the graph, simply drag the sliders from either side. To pan the zoomed area, click and hold in the white area and move left or right. Click _Reset Zoom_ to reset the zoom level.

Note that when zooming the graph or scrolling the table, dashboard auto-refresh will pause and the time range will show the frozen time. To resume refresh, click the _Resume_ button image:ResumeButton.png[]. This will also reset the zoom level.

At any point, you can click on _Create a Log Monitor_ to create a new Monitor based on the current filter.


== Log Details

Clicking anywhere in a log entry in the list will open a detail pane for that entry.  Here you can explore more information about the event. 

Click on "Add Filter" to add the selected field to the current filter. The log entry list will update based on the new filter.

== Troubleshooting

Here you will find suggestions for troubleshooting problems with Log Queries. 

|===
|*Problem:* | *Try this:* 
|I don't see "debug" messages in my log query
|Debug log messaging is not collected. To capture messages you want, change the relevant message severity to _informational, error, alert, emergency,_ or _notice_ level.
