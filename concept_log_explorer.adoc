The Cloud Insights Log Explorer is a powerful tool for querying EMS and Kubernetes logs. In addition to helping with investigations, you can also save a log query in a Monitor to provide alerts when log triggers are activated.

NOTE: Log Explorer is a _Preview_ feature and is therefore subject to change.

To begin exploring logs, click *Queries > +New Log Query*.

Select an available log from the list.

NOTE: A select set of logs are accessible for Preview; additional logs will be available over time.

You can set filters to further refine the results of the query. For example, to find all log messages showing a failure, set a filter for _Messages_ containing *failed*.  

TIP: You can begin typing the value to filter for in the filter field; Cloud Insights will prompt you to create a wildcard search containing the types string.
