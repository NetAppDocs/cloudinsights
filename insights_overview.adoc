Insights allow you to look into things like resource usage and how it affects other resources, or time-to-full analyses.

A number of Insights are available. Navigate to *Dashboards > Insights* to start diving in.

== Insight Types

=== Shared Resources Under Stress

High-impact workloads can reduce the performance of other workloads in a shared resource. This puts the shared resource under stress. Cloud Insights provides tools to help you investigate resource saturation and impact in your environment. link:insights_shared_resources_under_stress.html[Learn More]

=== Kubernetes Namespaces Running Out of Space

The Kubernetes Namespaces Running Out of Space Insight gives you a view into workloads on your Kubernetes namespaces that are at risk of running out of space, with an estimate for the number of days remaining before each space becomes full. link:insights_k8s_namespaces_running_out_of_space.html[Learn More]
