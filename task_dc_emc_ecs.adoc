This data collector acquires inventory and performance data from EMC ECS storage systems. For configuration, the data collector requires an IP address of the ECS server and an administrative level domain account.

NOTE: Dell EMC ECS is metered at a different Raw TB to Managed Unit rate. Every 40 TB of unformatted ECS capacity is charged as 1 link:concept_subscribing_to_cloud_insights.html#pricing[Managed Unit (MU)].

== Terminology

Cloud Insights acquires the following inventory information from the ECS data collector. For each asset type acquired, the most common terminology used for this asset is shown. When viewing or troubleshooting this data collector, keep the following terminology in mind:

Note: These are common terminology mappings only and might not represent every case for this data collector.

== Requirements

* An IP address of the ECS Management Console
* Administrative level domain account for the ECS system
* Port 443 (HTTPS).  Requires outbound connectivity to TCP port 443 on the ECS system. 
* For performance, read-only username and password for ssh/scp access.
* For performance, port 22 is required.

Some things to try if you encounter problems with this data collector:

==== Inventory

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:
|Error: User authentication failed.
|Make sure your credentials for this device are correct.
|===

==== Performance

[cols=2*, options="header", cols"50,50"]
|===
|Problem:|Try this:
|Error: VPLEX performance for version below 5.3 is not supported.
|Upgrade VPLEX to 5.3 or above

|Error: No enough data collected.
|•	Check collection timestamp in log file and modify polling interval accordingly
•	Wait for longer time

|Error: Perpetual Log files not being updated.
|Please contact EMC support to enable updating the perpetual log files

|Error: Performance polling interval is too big.
|Check collection timestamp in log file ${logfile} and modify polling interval accordingly

|Error: Performance Remote IP address of VPLEX Management Console is not configured.
|Edit the data source to set Performance Remote IP address of VPLEX Management Console.

|Error: No performance data reported from director
|•	Check that the system performance monitors are running correctly
