Webhooks allow users to send alert notifications to various applications using a customized webhook channel.

Many commercial applications support webhooks as a standard input interface, for example: Slack, PagerDuty, Teams, and Discord all support webhooks. By supporting a generic, customizable webhook channel, Cloud Insights can support many of these delivery channels. Information on webhooks can be found on these application websites. For example, Slack provides link:https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks[this useful guide].

You can create multiple webhook channels, each channel targeted for a different purpose; separate applications, different recipients, etc. 

The webhook channel instance is comprised of the following elements:

|===
|Name|Unique name
|URL|Webhook target URL, including the _http://_ or _https://_ prefix
|Method	|GET, POST - Default is POST
|Custom Header|Specify any custom header lines here
|Message Body|Put the body of your message here
|Default Alert Parameters|Lists the default parameters for the webhook
|Custom Parameters and Secrets|Custom parameters and secrets allow you to add unique parameters and secure elements such as passwords

Cloud Insights webhooks comprise a number of default parameters. Additionally, you can create your own custom parameters or secrets.

==== Parameters: What are they and how do I use them?

Alert Parameters are dynamic values populated per alert. For example, the _%%TriggeredOn%%_ parameter will be replaced with the object on which the alert was triggered.

==== Custom Parameters and Secrets

In this section you can add any custom parameters and/or secrets you wish. For security reasons, if a secret is defined only the webhook creator can modify this webhook channel. It is read-only for others.

=== Choosing Webhook Notification in a Monitor

To choose the webhook notification in a link:task_create_monitor.html#creating-a-monitor[monitor], go to *Alerts > Manage Monitors* and select the desired monitor, or add a new monitor. In the _Set up team notifications_ section, choose _Webhook_ as the delivery method. Select the alert levels (Critical, Warning, Resolved), then choose the desired webhook.
