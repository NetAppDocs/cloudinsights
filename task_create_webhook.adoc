Webhooks allow users to send alert notifications to various applications using a customized webhook channel.

NOTE: This documentation is considered _Preview_ documentation and is therefore subject to change.

Many commercial applications support webhooks as a standard input interface, for example: Slack, Jira, Zapier, Discord, and Twilio all support webhooks. By supporting a generic, customizable webhook channel, Cloud Insights can support many of these delivery channels. Information on Webhooks can be found on these application websites.

You can create multiple webhook channels, each channel targeted for a different purpose; separate applications, different recipients, etc. 

The webhook channel instance is comprised of the following elements:

|===
|Name|Unique name
|URL|Webhook target URL, including the _http/_ or _https/_ prefix
|Method	|GET, POST, PUT, HEAD, DELETE, PATCH, OPTIONS - Default is POST
|Payload|Message body
Custom Headers
|Form-encoded	|Form encoded serialization (Boolean)
|Secrets|A set of secret parameters (api-key, token, password) that will not be visible to users and will be encrypted in the DB. 
A user can embed these parameters to alert fields
|===

To create a Cloud Insights webhook, go to *Admin > Notifications* and select the *Webhooks* tab.

The following image shows an example Webhook configured for Discord:

Cloud Insights webhooks comprise a number of default parameters.  You can create your own custom parameters or secrets.
