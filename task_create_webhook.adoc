Webhooks allow users to send alert notifications to various applications using a customized webhook channel.

Many commercial applications support webhooks as a standard input interface, for example: Slack, Jira, Zapier, and Twilio all support webhooks. By supporting a generic, customizable webhook channel, Cloud Insights can support many of these delivery channels.
